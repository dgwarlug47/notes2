# Vegetables

Rinse your veggies under running water and scrub tougher ones with a vegetable brush. Top and tail vegetables with stems or tips.
Cut the vegetables into bite-sized pieces, or one-inch (2.5-cm) cubes. Place the veggies into a microwave safe dish, such as a glass bowl.
Cover the bowl tightly with a lid or plastic wrap. Place the veggies on the rotating plate and microwave on high for between 4.5 minutes (for one pound of veggies) and 9 minutes (for two pounds).
Remove one corner of the lid or puncture a few holes in the plastic to allow steam to escape before serving.
