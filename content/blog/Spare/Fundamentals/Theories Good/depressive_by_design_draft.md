How can long term happiness (deep relationships and purpose/meaning) can be achieved in scale of a lot of people through a long time? By a cohesive culture, because that enforces to people to have same experiences values same people thus make it easier to have deep relationships, and the "social Pressure" enforces them to have purpose. But you can't have a cohesive culture with liquid modernity (which the root cause is the second law of termodynamics), given the abudance of possibilities, and if you don't follow those possibilities you have the risk of becoming bacurau




Long term happiness of a large group of people = a large group of people having purpose and deep connections (break down into groups of people by deep connections) = groups of people having similar values beliefs experiences, and all of these people have purpose, (assume that meaning/purpose can only be achieved through social forcing) = groups of people having similar values beliefs experiences purposes, meanings, and similar locations


But this contradcits with liquid modernity



Long-term happiness for a large group of people is only possible if individuals possess both purpose and deep connections. These deep connections naturally form smaller groups within the larger population, and the strength of these connections depends on shared values, beliefs, experiences, and physical proximity. Purpose and meaning, in this context, are not merely individual choices but are socially constructed and enforced—people derive meaning through collective expectations and pressures.

Therefore, for sustained happiness at scale, society must organize itself into groups with aligned values, beliefs, experiences, purposes, meanings, and locations. This alignment is only possible within a cohesive culture, which provides the necessary social structure and pressure to maintain shared purpose and deep relationships.

However, this requirement fundamentally contradicts the conditions of liquid modernity, where rapid change, diversity of possibilities, and lack of stable traditions undermine the formation of cohesive groups. In liquid modernity, the abundance of choices and the breakdown of shared norms make it impossible to maintain the social forcing needed for collective purpose and deep connections.

Thus, the pursuit of long-term happiness for large groups is structurally incompatible with the realities of liquid modernity. The argument is logically airtight: the prerequisites for happiness at scale (cohesive groups with shared purpose) cannot coexist with the fragmentation and instability of liquid modernity.\
