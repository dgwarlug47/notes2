Decades of scientific research have shown that having a sense of purpose is essential for long-term happiness—second only second to deep, meaningful relationships. But how do we actually choose a purpose for ourselves? As Camus reminds us, life offers no objective meaning. The real question, then, is: what kind of purpose is actually wise to adopt?

In adulthood, the game most of us are invited to play is Capitalism, where the main objective is the accumulation of capital. At first glance, it might seem uninspiring—even counterintuitive—to embrace the default system of our society as your personal purpose. Why should you care so much about money? Yet, swimming against the current can be costly.

Think of it like basketball: if you decide your goal is something entirely unrelated to scoring points, you’ll miss out on the core benefits of the game. In the context of work and capitalism, these benefits include:

1. **Feedback:** The system provides constant feedback from others, which can help you grow into a more virtuous and competent person.
2. **Recognition:** Achieving within the system fulfills a basic human need for acknowledgment and respect.
3. **Leverage:** If you play well, you gain more resources—giving you the power to pursue your own interests and make a greater impact.
4. **People:** Because others are striving toward the same goals, you can build strong “game-based” relationships—connections rooted in shared challenges and ambitions. While these bonds may not be as deep as personal relationships outside the game, they are meaningful within this context and can greatly enhance your sense of belonging and long-term happiness.

Whether we like it or not, staying at least somewhat aligned with the broader goals of our society is often necessary for lasting happiness. Going completely against the grain can lead to isolation and frustration, while finding purpose within the system can offer connection, fulfillment, and stability.
