# When people ask me about it

I like to interpret the world cup in terms of:

1. Anthropology
- ethos/rituals
2. Hegel
3. Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde

- [MYTAKE] I find this game magical, because Brazil's strange case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. How come a team can be so absolutely beautiful on the offense, but so careless and pathethic on the defense
