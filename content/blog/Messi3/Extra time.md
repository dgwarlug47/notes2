# Childhood

<img src="image-56.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>

## Background
- Messi was born in 1987, a year after Maradona's World Cup victory.
    - [MYTAKE] For me, this feels like a prophecy. It even sounds like something out of Avatar: The Last Airbender; after one football god peaked, the next one was born.
- He is a descendant of Italians and Spaniards; in fact, the Spanish side of his family came from Catalonia.
    - [MYTAKE] This is incredibly symbolic; I can't imagine anything more fitting.
- From a young age, Messi showed great attachment to the ball, refusing to go shopping with his family unless he could take a ball with him.
    - [MYTAKE] Hilarious!
- His grandmother played a fundamental role in his career, even when he was very young.
    - There was no youth team for him, so she convinced the coach to let him play. She was the only person in the family who truly encouraged him to pursue football.
- At the age of eleven, his grandmother, Celia, passed away.

## Romance
- "I've liked Antonela since I was a boy. I love her more than anything. I'd say it was love at first sight."

## Growth Problem
- At eleven, Messi was diagnosed with a hormonal problem that slowed his bone development and, consequently, his growth.[22][23] For a year and a half, the $900 monthly treatment,[22] which involved alternating injections in each leg every night, was paid for by the foundation where his father worked until the funding ran out.[22] Since Newell's Old Boys did not want to cover the treatment costs, his father offered Messi to River Plate.[22][23] River's interest made Newell's reconsider, but they only offered 200 pesos a month.[22]
    - [MYTAKE] This feels like another sign of destiny. What seemed like a terrible condition actually contributed to his footballing skills, such as his low center of gravity. Messi's early life reminds me of the book *Outliers*, where exceptional success requires a perfect alignment of circumstances. For Messi, it was being Argentinian, having low hormone growth, and so many other factors aligning perfectly.
    - [MYTAKE] Perhaps everyone has a unique set of circumstances that make them perfect for something.

## Messi Goes to Barcelona
- To escape Argentina's economic crisis, Messi's father decided to try his luck abroad.[24] A cousin of Jorge Messi's mother lived in Lleida, Catalonia, and took the family in. Lionel was observed by a Barcelona scout,[24] who recommended him for trials at the club. At thirteen years old and 1.40 meters tall, Messi impressed against boys two years older. However, President Joan Gaspart and sporting director Carles Rexach hesitated to sign him due to the costs of his treatment and relocating his family.

## Messi's Shyness
- Gerard Piqué said that during Messi's first month on the professional team, people thought he was mute because he didn't say a word. Cesc Fàbregas noted that Messi spoke in a very low Argentine accent, making it difficult to talk to him.

## Ronaldinho's Prophecy
- After Ronaldinho's first training session with Messi, he told a journalist friend: "I just trained with someone who is going to be better than me." When Kobe Bryant visited Barcelona, Ronaldinho told him that Messi would be the best. Ronaldinho noticed Messi's shyness and invited him to join his group of friends in Barcelona. They lived on the same street, and Ronaldinho even taught Messi Spanish and Portuguese. To this day, Messi considers Ronaldinho a father figure. Before a friendly match between Barcelona and Juventus, Samuel Eto'o warned Patrick Vieira about Messi, saying that one day, Messi would make every player before him seem like they were playing a different sport.

## Messi's First Goal for Barcelona
- After scoring his first goal, Messi climbed on Ronaldinho's back, symbolizing how much Ronaldinho valued the moment.
    - [MYTAKE] This goal is legendary. Ronaldinho, the best player at the time, asking a 16-year-old to climb on his back shows his humility and vision. Also, Messi's first goal being a chip, his trademark, is poetic.

## Comparisons with Maradona
- Early in his career, Messi scored a goal with his hand and another where he dribbled past everyone. These goals were scored in a short period, drawing comparisons to Maradona's iconic performances in the 1986 World Cup against England.
    - [MYTAKE] Messi's career is filled with moments that feel like acts of destiny.

## Copa América
- Runner-up, losing to Brazil in the final 3-0. Notably, Brazil's best players, like Ronaldinho, Roberto Carlos, and Kaká, were absent.

## Champions League
### First Match Against Cristiano Ronaldo
- Messi faced Cristiano Ronaldo for the first time in the Champions League semi-final. It was a tight game with few opportunities; Paul Scholes scored the only goal across both legs.
