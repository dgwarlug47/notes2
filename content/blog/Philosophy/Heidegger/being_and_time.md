# Key Concepts and Notes

## **Ente** and **Ser**
- Something can be both "ente" (concretely existing) and "ser" (yet to be defined, with multiple possible "ente"s).


---

# **Kinds of Being**

## **Ready-to-hand (Zuhandenheit)**
- Describes how we interact with things in everyday life, focusing on their practical utility and how they facilitate our actions.

## **Present-at-hand (Vorhandenheit)**
- Refers to how things appear when they are not immediately useful, but instead exist as objects with specific properties.

## **Dasein**

# **Dasein**

## Revitalizing the Question of Being
- Dasein seeks to understand what it means *to be*.

## Characteristics of Being
1. **Being-in-the-world**  
     - Involves space and time.
2. **Being-toward-death**  
     - Mortality drives action; without it, time would feel infinite.

## Dasein and Possibilities
- Dasein always understands itself in terms of possibilities.  
- It can either follow "The They" self or strive for a more authentic understanding.

## Essence of Dasein
- Dasein is not static; it changes constantly, much like the atoms and cells that make up our bodies.

## **DEFINITION**

IMPORTANT DEFINITION OF WORLD
- network of meaningful involvement
- [MYTAKE] I think it's very interesting, because for example in Vancouver my friends and I have a very similar existence because we live in the same world, the same spatial world, same meaning for same the same things: panaroma ridge, visa, same sorge (concern) team onboarding, learning Azure, and same meaning for the same things in general
- [MYTAKE] I love how phenomenologist and subjective Heidegger's understanding is for, it is as if his vision of world is completely real and personal
- [MYTAKE] I think one of the reasons why spouses are so similar is that they share so much of the same world

Parts of the world
- Referential Totality (Verweisungszusammenhang)
- - The world is made up of things that refer to one another in a network of practical relations
- Significance (Bedeutsamkeit)
- Concern (Besorgen)
- - - Producing, attending, making use of, letting go, accomplishing, interrogating, considering, and discussing.
- Publicness / The ‚ÄúThey‚Äù (das Man)
- Mood or Attunement (Befindlichkeit)
- - We are always already in a mood or emotional tone before thinking or acting.  
    - Examples: waking up anxious, feeling awkward in a room, or being thrown into grief.  
- These moods reveal how we are situated in the world.
- Thrownness (Geworfenheit)
- Projection (Entwurf)
- Discourse and language
- - Heidegger emphasizes the power of language:
    - ‚ÄúMan acts as though he were the shaper and master of language, while in fact language remains the master of man.‚Äù


| **Heidegger‚Äôs World**  | **Is...**                                               | **Is Not...**                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| A web of significance  | Where entities show up as useful, threatening, relevant | A set of physical locations or objective facts |
| Structured by care     | Shaped by our goals, emotions, and mortality            | Independent of human involvement               |
| Contextual and dynamic | Formed through action and breakdown                     | Static or universal                            |

Example 3: Losing a Job.
When someone loses their job, they don‚Äôt just lose income‚Äîthey may feel like their world collapses:

Social roles,

Daily routines,

Future projects,

Sense of purpose.

| **Absorption in the "they"** (*das Man*) | Living according to what ‚Äúone does‚Äù or ‚Äúpeople say.‚Äù                      |
| **Idle Talk** (*Gerede*)                 | Speaking in clich√©s, unexamined opinions, or gossip.                      |
| **Curiosity** (*Neugier*)                | Restless seeking of novelty without depth‚Äîe.g. compulsive news-scrolling. |
| **Ambiguity** (*Zweideutigkeit*)         | Lack of clarity‚Äîeverything seems understood, but nothing really is.       |
