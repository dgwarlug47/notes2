# **Kinds of Being**

## Revitalizing the Question of Being
- Heidegger seeks to understand what it means *to be*.

## **Ready-to-hand (Zuhandenheit)**
- Describes how we interact with things in everyday life, focusing on their practical utility and how they facilitate our actions.

## **Present-at-hand (Vorhandenheit)**
- Refers to how things appear when they are not immediately useful, but instead exist as objects with specific properties.

## **Dasein**
---

# **Being-there (Dasein)**

## Characteristics of Being
1. **Being-in-the-world (In-der-Welt-sein)**  
     - Involves space and time.
2. **Being-toward-death (Sein-zum-Tode)**  
     - Mortality drives action; without it, time would feel infinite.

## Dasein and Possibilities
- Dasein always understands itself in terms of possibilities.  
- It can either follow "The They" self or strive for a more authentic understanding.

## Essence of Dasein

1. are aware of their own being,

2. interpret themselves, and

3. exist in relation to the world and others.

- Dasein is not static; it changes constantly, much like the atoms and cells that make up our bodies.

### Real world example, The Student in a Library

You‚Äôre sitting in a library, studying for an exam. You‚Äôre not just a brain processing information. You are:

1. caring about your future,

2. interpreting your life as one where passing this exam matters,

3. acting in a shared world (e.g., the idea of education, grades, careers).

üëâ Dasein is the being that finds itself in this meaningful activity, not just a body occupying a chair.

# **Being-in-the-world (In-der-Welt-sein)**

## **DEFINITION**

IMPORTANT DEFINITION OF WORLD
- network of meaningful involvement
- [MYTAKE] I think it's very interesting, because for example in Vancouver my friends and I have a very similar existence because we live in the same world, the same spatial world, same meaning for same the same things: panaroma ridge, visa, same sorge (concern) team onboarding, learning Azure, and same meaning for the same things in general
- [MYTAKE] I love how phenomenologist and subjective Heidegger's understanding is for, it is as if his vision of world is completely real and personal
- [MYTAKE] I think one of the reasons why spouses are so similar is that they share so much of the same world

Parts of the world
- Referential Totality (Verweisungszusammenhang)
- - The world is made up of things that refer to one another in a network of practical relations
- Significance (Bedeutsamkeit)
- Concern (Besorgen)
- - - Producing, attending, making use of, letting go, accomplishing, interrogating, considering, and discussing.
- Publicness / The ‚ÄúThey‚Äù (das Man)
- Mood or Attunement (Befindlichkeit)
- - We are always already in a mood or emotional tone before thinking or acting.  
    - Examples: waking up anxious, feeling awkward in a room, or being thrown into grief.  
- These moods reveal how we are situated in the world.
- Thrownness (Geworfenheit)
- Projection (Entwurf)
- Discourse and language
- - Heidegger emphasizes the power of language:
    - ‚ÄúMan acts as though he were the shaper and master of language, while in fact language remains the master of man.‚Äù


| **Heidegger‚Äôs World**  | **Is...**                                               | **Is Not...**                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| A web of significance  | Where entities show up as useful, threatening, relevant | A set of physical locations or objective facts |
| Structured by care     | Shaped by our goals, emotions, and mortality            | Independent of human involvement               |
| Contextual and dynamic | Formed through action and breakdown                     | Static or universal                            |

## Example Losing a Job.
When someone loses their job, they don‚Äôt just lose income‚Äîthey may feel like their world collapses:

1. Social roles

2. Daily routines

3. Future projects

4. Sense of purpose

| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Absorption in the "they"** (*das Man*) | Living according to what ‚Äúone does‚Äù or ‚Äúpeople say.‚Äù                      |
| **Idle Talk** (*Gerede*)                 | Speaking in clich√©s, unexamined opinions, or gossip.                      |
| **Curiosity** (*Neugier*)                | Restless seeking of novelty without depth‚Äîe.g. compulsive news-scrolling. |
| **Ambiguity** (*Zweideutigkeit*)         | Lack of clarity‚Äîeverything seems understood, but nothing really is.       |

# Authenticity

## **1. Being-toward-death (Sein-zum-Tode)**

Recognizing that death is inevitable and uniquely yours.

Living with the awareness that your time is limited.

Death individualizes Dasein ‚Äî no one else can die for you.

‚ÄúDeath is Dasein's ownmost possibility ‚Äî non-relational and not to be outstripped.‚Äù

## **2.Resoluteness (Entschlossenheit)**

Committing to a life project that reflects your own values.

Taking decisive, clear action even in uncertainty.

Not being swayed by the anonymous voice of ‚Äúthe They‚Äù (das Man).

## **3. Freedom and Responsibility**

Freedom is not abstract choice, but the responsibility to choose meaningfully.

Dasein is thrown into the world (not chosen), but must take a stand on that thrownness.

## **4.Owning One‚Äôs Thrownness (Geworfenheit)**

You didn‚Äôt choose your birth, language, culture, or time ‚Äî but they‚Äôre the conditions of your existence.

Authenticity is not escaping thrownness, but responding to it freely.

## **5.Anxiety (Angst)**

Unlike fear, anxiety is not about something specific.

It reveals the groundlessness of existence and the burden of freedom.

In anxiety, Dasein sees that no external authority can tell it how to be.
