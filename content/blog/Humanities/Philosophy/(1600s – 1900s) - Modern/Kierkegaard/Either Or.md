# Either/Or by Søren Kierkegaard - Main Concepts

## Overview
"Either/Or" (1843) is Kierkegaard's exploration of two fundamental life approaches through the perspectives of two pseudonymous authors: the aesthete "A" and the ethicist Judge William.

### 1. **The Aesthetic Stage**
The first stage of existence characterized by immediate pleasure-seeking, living in the moment, and avoiding commitment. The aesthete pursues novelty, beauty, and sensual experiences without deeper reflection.
- Life = maximize(pleasure(t))

### 2. **The Ethical Stage**
The second stage of existence where one commits to universal moral principles, duty, and social responsibilities. This involves choosing oneself as a moral being and accepting the weight of decision-making.
- Commitment over impulse
- Continuity
- Stable Identity

### 3. **The Either/Or Choice**
The fundamental existential choice between living aesthetically (pleasure-focused) or ethically (duty-focused). This choice cannot be made rationally but requires a passionate leap of decision.

### Step 1 — Define the variables

Let’s name the pieces explicitly.

- **A** = actual self  
    → your lived life, actions, habits, concrete existence
    
- **I** = ideal self  
    → who you think you should be, your values, possibilities
    
- **R(x, y)** = relation between x and y  
    → awareness, evaluation, responsibility, judgment
    - To relate is to be consciously positioned toward something — to interpret it, care about it, evaluate it, and hold oneself answerable in relation to it.

- [Second-order relating] Relating your Relating between your actual self and ideal self
