# Concepts

What is an ethnic group?
- An ethnicity or ethnic group is a group of people who identify with each other on the basis of perceived shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups.

What is Culture
- Knowledge, beliefes, art, moral, law, customs

Evolution of culture
- I think we can have "much" more culture than other civilzations because we can write stuff

Ethnocentrismo
- Ethnocentrism which is in social science and it is in anthropology—as well as in colloquial English discourse—means to apply one's own culture or ethnicity as a frame of reference to judge other cultures, practices, behaviors, beliefs, and people, instead of using the standards of the particular culture involved.

# Great minds

## 1. Franz Boas (1858–1942)
Known as the "Father of Modern Anthropology".
He challenged scientific racism and developed the idea of cultural relativism—the belief that cultures should be understood on their own terms.
Founder of American cultural anthropology.
Major Works: "The Mind of Primitive Man" and "Race, Language, and Culture".
Legacy: Influenced a generation of anthropologists, including Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict.

## 2. Claude Lévi-Strauss (1908–2009)

We have a file for him

## 3. Bronisław Malinowski (1884–1942)

Legacy
- Pioneer of ethnographic fieldwork
- Participant observation.
- Functionalism
- - Malinowski developed a theory of functionalism, which argued that all cultural practices and institutions serve specific functions to meet the needs of individuals or the society as a whole.
- - He believed culture functions to satisfy basic human needs (e.g., biological, psychological, and social).
- - Example: Magic and rituals, though seemingly irrational, serve to reduce uncertainty and provide emotional security.


### Kula Ring

Redefining Economic Exchange
- The Kula Ring demonstrated that economic systems are not solely driven by material wealth or profit, as assumed in many Western economies.
- Instead, exchanges can serve social, cultural, and symbolic purposes.
- The ceremonial exchange of soulava (red necklaces) and mwali (white armbands) had no intrinsic material value but carried immense social significance.

Understanding reciprocity
- The Kula Ring operates on the principle of reciprocity, a concept foundational to anthropological theories of exchange.
- Gifts are not given freely; they create obligations and social bonds between individuals and communities.
- This reciprocity sustains long-term relationships and ensures continued interaction among islanders.

Functionalism in action
- Malinowski used the Kula Ring as evidence for his functionalist theory, which states that every cultural practice serves a specific function to fulfill the needs of individuals or society.
- The Kula Ring satisfies the need for:
- Social relationships: Building trust and cooperation.
- Psychological security: Reducing isolation and fostering community.
- Cultural stability: Reinforcing traditions and norms.
