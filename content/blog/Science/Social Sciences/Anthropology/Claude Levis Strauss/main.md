# Structuralism

## Definition
- Lévi-Strauss understood structure as the underlying logical systems and binary oppositions (like nature/culture or raw/cooked) that organize human thought and culture beneath the surface of what people explicitly say or do. He believed these deep structures are universal across all human societies, revealed through analyzing myths, kinship systems, and language as systems of relationships and contrasts rather than as isolated elements.

## Argument in favour of structuralism
- Incesto is a a tabu in many societies
- - A pergunta do porque? Poderia ser pelo horror ou por experiencia de que isso causa doencas geneticas.
- - Para o Levi Strauss, se o pai mantivesse relacoes sexuais com a filha, isso nao seria optimo dentro de uma perspectiva material, porque se a filha casa com outro homem, eh como se estivesse acontencendo uma troca entre dois homens, que benefeciam o pai.


## Another argument for structuralism
- Santa Claus and Katchina
- - Katchina: in ceremonies, adults dressed as Kachinas interact with children, teaching them cultural stories and sometimes admonishing or rewarding them for their behavior.
- - Kachinas: Through ceremonies and rituals, Kachinas teach moral lessons, cultural values, and proper behavior to community members, especially children.
- - same myth that come from both the same social structure that there is a division between mature and imature people, and how to teach the immature people how to behave correctly

## Title
- He laments the loss of cultural diversity as traditional ways of life are eroded by globalization, exploitation, and modernity.
> "The world began without man and will end without him. Tristes Tropiques is the story of this passage, of the vanishing of cultures, of the fading of diversity." — Claude Lévi-Strauss
- The Diminishment of cultural diversity reduces the human experience as a whole, for example when you travel to japan, don't you like seeing different things, isn't that enjoyable? Due to globalization everywhere we go is just a differnt implementation of amercanism.
> "Travel, which was once a means of discovering diversity, now only reveals the monotony of a world that has become uniform." — Tristes Tropiques

This book is about many tribes he met in Brazil and his research on it

## Cultural Relativism
- It's crazy that when we see that guy having a tattoo denoting social status in a tribe, we think it's stpuid but if we see something very similar on our culture we think it is normal.
> "The barbarian is, first and foremost, the man who believes in barbarism." — Tristes Tropiques

## Why participant observation is important
- Because if we simply observe their culture, we won't be able to identify the root causes of their own culture, we need to immerse themselves to fully understand them
> "The observer must immerse himself in the life of the people, sharing their daily existence, in order to understand the true nature of their society." — Tristes Tropiques

## Ritual as a mechanism for social cohesion and cultural transmission
- By applying the rituals, individuals participate in their culture and internalize/perpetuate their society/culture
> "Rituals are the means by which society renews itself, binding individuals together and transmitting its values from one generation to the next." — Tristes Tropiques

## Structuralism in myths
- Even though myths can vary a lot they underly the same structure
> "Myths are the instruments by which we break down the contradictions of existence, reconciling the irreconcilable through narrative and symbol." — Tristes Tropiques
- Myths work to mediate and resolve fundamental oppositions in human experience, such as
	- Life vs. Death.
	- Nature vs. Culture.
- Expression of the Inexpressible
	- Myths address existential questions and human dilemmas that cannot be easily explained or resolved in literal terms.
	- They use symbolic language and narrative to explore the mysteries of existence.

## Western vs native
- Environment
- More community and belonging
> "The so-called primitive societies are not less complex than our own; they are simply organized according to different principles, which we must strive to understand." — Tristes Tropiques

## Etnography can makes us better understand our own etnhicity
- Defamiliarization of the Familiar
	- In a similar way that the person that struggles the most to solve a problem is the one facing it, by defamilirazing with our culture, we can more clearly denormalize our own society and see more clearly its problems
- Identifying the essence/universal structures
> "It is only by distancing ourselves from our own society that we can begin to see it clearly, to recognize its structures and its limitations." — Tristes Tropiques
