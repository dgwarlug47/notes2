2. Representation
3. Shapes, colors, materials



Impact
- American skyscrapers marked the summit of the Art Deco style; they became the tallest and most recognizable modern buildings in the world

Representation
- Art Deco represents a sense of glamour and elegance. It was a style that represented luxury and sophistication, especially in the context of the Roaring Twenties and the Jazz Age
-  They were designed to show the prestige of their builders through their height, their shape, their color, and their dramatic illumination at night
- As Marx would say the superstructure comes from the material base, since the US was getting insanely rich at the time, they created an architecture (a subset of the superstructure) that fit that growth

# Characteristics

Shapes
- Art Deco often features geometric shapes, including zigzags, chevrons, and stepped patterns. These shapes convey a sense of modernity and precision

Colors
- Art Deco employs bold and vibrant colors, including rich jewel tones such as deep blues, greens, and reds. Black and white combinations are also common

Materials
- The use of luxurious and exotic materials is a hallmark of Art Deco. Materials such as lacquer, chrome, glass, and inlaid wood were frequently used to create a sense of opulence

Influence
- Art Deco drew inspiration from a variety of cultures, including Ancient Egyptian, Aztec, and African art. These influences are often evident in the stylized and geometric motifs.
