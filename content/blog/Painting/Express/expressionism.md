Prelude
- Works were surreal in tone and portrayed characters in a world of despair and perplexity. As a man who lived life with depression lingering within his every move, it is no surprise that this sense of confusion was so incessant within his works


Street, Dresden (1908)
- Museum of modern art (2023)
- Street, Dresden is Kirchnerâ€™s bold, discomfiting attempt to render the jarring experience of modern urban bustle. The scene radiates tension. Its packed pedestrians are locked in a constricting space; the plane of the sidewalk, in an unsettlingly intense pink (part of a palette of shrill and clashing colors), slopes steeply upward, and the exit to the rear is blocked by a trolley car. The streetâ€”Dresdenâ€™s fashionable KÃ¶nigstrasseâ€”is crowded, even claustrophobically so, yet everyone seems alone. The women at right, one clutching her purse, the other her skirt, are holding themselves in, and their faces are expressionless, almost masklike. A little girl is dwarfed by her hat, one in a network of eddying, whorling shapes that entwine and enmesh the human figures

Scream
- Most important work in expressionism
- The expression of Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) in the poster for the 1990 film Home Alone was inspired by The Scream
- In most renderings, the emoji U+1F631 ðŸ˜± FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR is made to resemble the subject of the painting
