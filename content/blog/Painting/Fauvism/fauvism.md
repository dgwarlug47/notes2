# History

Origin
- Fauvism vem de fauves - fera
- Foundation on the Salon 1905
- The name originated from a remark of the French art critic Louis Vauxcelles at the Salon of 1905; coming across a quattrocento-style statue in the midst of works by Matisse and his associates, he is reputed to have said, 'Donatello au milieu des fauves! ' ('Donatello among the wild beasts').

# Characteristics

IMPORTANT - IT'S PART OF EXPRESSIONISM

1. Impulsive lines
2. Simplifixed drawing
3. Vibrant colours

Why I like it
- I gives a playful vibe because of the diversity of colours, it incites in me something imaginative
- It is as if it is okay and even respectable to be "childish"

View of Collioure
- Museum Hermitage (Russia)
- "Tive a sensacao da tonalidade de uma cor. Entao, estendia a primeira cor,
acrescentava uma segunda e, depois se me parecia nao concordar com a primeira,
no lugar de corrigi-la, aplicava uma terceira, que tinh aa capacidade da harmoniza-las,
ate a harmonia final"
- "Abandonada a impressao - o motivo, o tom local - o que passa a guiar a obra eh unica
e exclusivamente uma busca pela harmonia na expressao. Dessa forma, as cores abitrarias
(rosas no releveols, lilas nas paredes) sao justapostas a cores naturlistas (o azul no mar)
e verossimeis (o laranja nas telhas)
- "as cores se tornam um veiculo expressov priveligado e o caminho em direcao a abstracao"
