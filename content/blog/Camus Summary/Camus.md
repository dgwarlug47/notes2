# Personal

Camus was born in Algeria in 1913. His father was killed a year later in WWI, and Camus was brought up by this mother in extreme poverty.

He won the nobel prize

He joined the Communist party in 1935

He died at age of 46, having discarded attain ticket to acept a lift back to Paris with a friend, which exemplifies the absurdity of life
- Isn't it ironic that he died in a very absurd way, and he himself is absurdist

# The BIG question

There is one truly philosophical problem of philosophy: which is the problem of whether to suicide or not

There are three answers for this problem:

1) Suicide

2) Philosophical suicide
- there are many types of philosophical suicides, but they will all be related to believing that the universe as a whole has some meaning
- The absurd, for Camus, is the feeling that we have when we recognize that the meanings we give to life do not exist beyond our own consciouness
- - IMPORTANT: I love this about Camus because he doesn't run from the main question, that got me into studying philosophy in the first place. Because in the end of the day Nietzsche commits philosophical suicide, when we talks about the will to power, as well as Satre also commits philosophical suicide when talks about living an authenthic life
- 99.99999999999999999% of people choose this option, including myself
3) Absurdism
- In embracing the absurd (the lack of meaning in the world, even when we are constantly looking for meaning), we constantly try to find value, or subjective meaning in life, even when there isn't an objective meaning, which is absurd, that's why it's called embracing the absurd

## Myth of sysiphus

For Camus this myth encapsualtes well our big question, because Sysiphus is forced to do a task even though he is fully aware it's meaningless, but still he has to do it, which epitomizes the absurdity of our lives
