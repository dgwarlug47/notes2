## Story

The Impressionist movement offered him an alternative to the rigid expectations of European painting at the time and gave him an outlet to begin experimenting with his own style

he painted paris view from Montmartre

Van Gogh, in contrast, struggled for recognition during his lifetime and only achieved widespread acclaim and recognition posthumously. His work had a profound influence on later art movements, such as Expressionism.

## Style

Van Gogh, on the other hand, is known for his distinctive post-impressionist style. He was more concerned with expressing his emotions and inner thoughts through his paintings. Van Gogh used bold, vibrant colors and dramatic, swirling brushstrokes to convey his intense feelings.

### difference between him and impressionism

The key difference is his use of unnatural and abstract colour in his work, which drew on colour contrasts rather than the effects of natural light. Van Gogh, on the other hand, chose to manipulate colour as a symbolic element in many of his paintings, using dramatic colour contrasts to create a sense of atmosphere rather than reality.

In my opinion, extreme angles, flattened forms, distorted views are already present in the late works of Van Gogh, therefore we can see that he was a bridge to the expressionism

As well as contrasting colours, Van Gogh also frequently used black in his painting. This is something that many impressionists sought to move away from. Manet and Morisot continued to use black but to a much lesser extent than many other artists.
