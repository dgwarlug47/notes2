# Chapter 1

Truman Capote's first apartment was in the Upper East Side in the Seventies Avenue.

Joe Bell owns a bar on Lexington Avenue (this is where they stayed with the baby).

Capote mentions that Holly is not in Manhattan because he hasn't seen her in 12 years, highlighting how small "Manhattan" high society can feel.

Critics:
- Introduces Holly's characteristics well.
- Her present is mysterious; we don't know where she is, making her a mysterious character.
- She has a strong presence wherever she goes, whether due to her walk, body, or clothes.
- The first time we hear Holly's dialogue, Capote is not in the room, making her feel distant.

Holly always loses her key, symbolizing her free spirit.

She had a date that night but dismissed him without explanation, simply saying good night.

She arrived home late, around 4 a.m., suggesting she had a lot of fun in New York high society.

Critics:
- Holly's "a cara da riqueza" personality feels artificial.
- Her country music singing and guitar playing contrast with her socialite persona.
- It takes a long time for the narrator to actually talk to her, making her seem inaccessible.
- Their friendship begins out of necessity, not mutual affection.
- Meeting her outside her social circle reveals her true self.
- Talking about her brother Fred shows her genuine side.

Holly visits a man in prison named Sally Tomato.

Her accent was smoothed out through French lessons, showing how much she was "made up" by her agent.

She was offered a movie role but gave it up.

Critics:
- Behind her dark glasses, Holly seems to have real interests and a childlike side, contrasting with her socialite persona.
- Giving up the job shows vulnerability, contrasting with her confident exterior.
- Her dislike of cages reflects her value for freedom.
- Her tendency to steal shows her love for adrenaline.
- Holly is confident and optimistic outwardly but struggles with identity and rebellion against being understood.

Holly seems to like older men, possibly due to marrying an older man at 14.

At first, Tiffany's seems to appeal to her for its expense and chicness, but it also provides her with calmness and security.

Holly starts showing interest in José, another woman's boyfriend.

Critics:
- Meeting Holly's "husband" and learning about her childhood explains her habit of running away and difficulty committing.
- Her actions, like dating José, show a lack of boundaries and a spoiled, jealous side.
- Fred's death deeply impacts her, adding complexity to her character.

Critics:
- The narrator's close friendship with Holly shows her "good" side.
- Her arrest for drug use was surprising but, in hindsight, not entirely unexpected.
- Holly refers to the narrator as "maude," a slang term for gay at the time.
- The narrator being naked during Holly's arrest hints at his sexuality.
- Holly's interest in the list of Brazil's richest men shows her socialite tendencies and intelligence.
- Her willingness to take risks, even suspecting Sally Tomato's dealings were shady, reflects her free-spirited nature.
- Holly's rejection of the cat symbolizes her unwillingness to accept close relationships or ownership.
- Her lack of contact with the narrator after leaving shows her inability to maintain long-term relationships.
