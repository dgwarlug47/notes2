# Chapter 1

When someone is poor  life is really hard, imagine he is struggling
to even burn the clothes with blood, because he has no lighter and
not a lot of clothes

the paranoia is the qorst part he is always thinking of the worst
case scenario, everything becomes a threat

It is very crazy when he gets paralizado when the Petrovitch is
asking where he went last night right before talking about the
pawnbroker case

# Chapter 2

When he was attending the 
university, he had hundreds of times—generally on his 
way home—stood still on this spot, gazed at this truly 
magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at a 
vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him 
strangely cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank 
and lifeless. He wondered every time at his sombre and 
enigmatic  impression  and,  mistrusting  himself,  put  off 
finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled those old 
doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was 
no mere chance that he recalled them now.
- beautiful

# Chapter 3

very interesting the fact that he becames he is semi lucid
it's like he can feel but he cannot control himself,
and we can see how much burden it is for him killing someone
because it made him sick after all

what a funny situation, he got unconsciousness and now he
needs to sign to accept the money, but he doesn't want because
it is from his mother. He is very prideful

he is so prideful his friend bought some clothes for him
and he got mad

# Chapter 4

Lizaveta Ivanovna is apparently well known by a lot of people
since she used to sell things door by door

they are going to condemn a painter that stole some ear rings

the author is managing to build some very contradictory story
how come the painter would have killed if he was playing right
before the pawnbroker died

note that the painter got the earings in an apartment other than
the one of the pawnbroker, in fact the main chracter hid in the
apartment where the painter was painting

# Chapter 5


Critics
- I think it is interesting the imagination that the auhor has to
create so many scnes in a room that pretty much only fits one sofa
- Razumikhin is destimido, he has no fear in talking with people
above him

Luzhin dresses really well, and he feels like a cartoon villan
because of his well behaving and aristocratic matters

Luzhin has involvements with the senate apparently he seems
quite important

Raskolnikov	becomres very ousado, apparently is he completely
foda se after commiting his crime, specially in the moments he
angry

Piotr Petrovitch is liberal apparently

but I've grown so sick during the last three 
years of this chattering to amuse oneself, of this incessant 
flow of commonplaces, always the same, that, by Jove, I 
blush even when other people talk like that. You are in a 
hurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don't 
blame you, that's quite pardonable. I only wanted to find 
out what sort of man you are, for so many unscrupulous 
people have got hold of the progressive cause of late and 
have so distorted in their own interests everything they 
touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the 
mire. That's enough!"
- feel very similar to him


oh my god, there were 1500 rublos in the pawnbroker's house
that he forgot to steal, how pathetic Raskolnikov is, it 
is incredible how everything he does is wrong, alongside that
it is now obvious that the guy that killed the old lady is
not good at doing crimes

Luzhin clearly doesn't like much poor people, and doesn't
seem to care much about them either

 "is it true that you told your fiancée... 
within an hour of her acceptance, that what pleased you 
most... was that she was a beggar... because it was better to 
raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete 
control over her, and reproach her with your being her 
benefactor?"  
- damn this is crazy

# Chapter 6

This internal conflict becomes visible in the scene in the Crystal Palace, in which, under the influence of a wild impulse, he nearly confesses to Zamyotov. He again nearly confesses during his visit to the scene of the crime. In later chapters, Porfiry Petrovich reveals that both incidents aroused suspicion among the police. In very definite ways, Raskolnikov’s impulsive and dangerous actions make him an instrument of his own downfall and his own worst enemy.

# Chapter 7

Katarina Ivanova is crazy, she said she had to wash the clothes
of the family everyday because each member only have one clothe

Also it's crazy how much petulancia she talks with her landlord
she calls her with the name she wants, she is completely prideful

Also the habits of the lower classes are very interesting, they
gather together when the father Marmeladov was almost dying

"O medico assmobrou-se: o policial contara-lhe que o homem tinha
sido arrastado pela rodda uns trinta passos"

what a crazy scene, a lot of poor people in a small apartment
with only one candle, with the mother praying, a priest and
the doctor and Marmeladov

Marmeladov said sorry for his daughter Sonya, hugged her and
died, it is very epic

"Ah agente precisa de forcas. aose faz nada sem forcas, e essas
forcas eh preciso conquista-las a forca"
