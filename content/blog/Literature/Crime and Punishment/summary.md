# When people ask me about it

Crime and Punishment
- What is a crime?
- - The modern relativism is applied into crime
- - The old lady raskolnikov killed was annoying. Is it that bad that he has killed her?
- - veia filosofica do livro
- What is a punishment?
- - In fact the crime is defined by the punishment, if you are suffering from punishment then you probably performed crime

# Philosophy

What is existentialism
- Dostoevsky was part of a movement called the existentialist movement– a movement consisting of writers and philosophers that debated the meaning of life, morality and the existence of God. All of Dostoevsky's work focuses around these important questions, with Crime and Punishment focusing on morality in particular.

Consequences of Nietzsche
- Crime and punishment is written in a similar time as Nietzsche
- The rejection of God by some, fueled by the Enlightenment and Darwinian morality, gave way to relativism– the concept that there is no such thing as right and wrong, but rather that morality is subjective. Without an objective reference frame by which to guide our moral values (i.e. God's nature), there can be no valid standard by which to judge right and wrong objectively, meaning that morality depends on preference only.

Every character represents a philosophy
- Sonya -> christianism
- Svidrigailov -> hedonism
- Lupin -> ubermensh

C&P is part one of what I consider a trilogy. It is an inspection of a man who believes rationality can usurp morality and the personal consequences he faces.

## Morality

What is morality
- Did he commit a crime? Why would that be considerede a crime?
are poor people more amoral than the richer people?

Ubermesch theory
- The theory that the world is divided between ordinary people
and extraordinary people, and the extraordinary ones are
entitled to do crimes
- I somehow believed this specially during university when
I didn't want to become a SWE, perhaps I was more ordinary
than extraorindary than I previously thought

Consequences of going against christianism
- Dostoevsky meant to depict that the desire to assert yourself above morality will destroy the soul of whomever attempts it, whether you are a psychopath like Svidrigailov or a normal person like Raskolnikov, you will fall to despair.

# Psychology

Punishment
- What makes Crime and Punishment great is that Dostoevsky's portrayal of Raskolnikov's behaviour after the murder is characteristic of the average murderer, according to psychoanalytic studies that were done subsequent to the writing of the novel.
- These neurotic tendencies lead to guilt feelings that cannot be
eradicated and explain Raskolnikov's desire for punishment even before
he commits the crime. He does everything to reveal himself because he
wishes to suffer in order to alleviate the feelings of guilt. This guilt and
subsequent desire for punishment become so strong that he commits
the murder
- He gets sick as fuck

Healing part 1
- Talking about the problem (this reminds a lot about me)
- I personally think that Crime and Punishment is also about the danger of internalising everything. Raskolnikov - due to his arrogance or suspicion of others - keeps everything to himself. He constantly has one single narrative going in his mind, and lack of dialogue with others is what perpetuates his misery and turmoil. It is only from the point where he confesses to Sonia that he finally gets to talk about the things that has been haunting him.

Healing part 2
- It's only from the love of Sonya that he is finally healed from the crime
- Even after going to siberia he still sees his crime as only a mistake, because in the end he is still thinking
rationally, and that's the problem. It is only when he let himself go wit the love for Sonya that the forgets

# Characters

## Raskolnikov

![alt text](image-3.png)

He represents the non philosophical suicide, and philosophical experimentation

- after his crime, he lied a lot, but whenever his lie is about
something related to his own dignity he won't lie even if that
makes obvious that he is the killer, for example when the 
investigator asked whether he was extraordinary or not and he
said yes
- for me his excess of rationalism is what destroyed his life
- The motivation of the student revo lutionary is quite evident.
Raskolnikov killed an old lady in ineffectual fury, to protest the
condition of the insulted and the injured. He killed the old woman to
protest the wretched conditions of the Marmeladovs, his own wretched
condition, and the co ndition of man who from poverty of soul and
body strikes in frustration at the symbol of the wre tchedness which
chains him. Motivated thus by social consc iousness, Raskolnikov
emerges as a scapegoat figure, carrying on his back to the martyrdom of
Siberia the accumulated guilt, shame, and injustice of the social order. 
- Alienation is the primary theme of Crime and Punishment. At first, Raskolnikov's pride separates him from society. He sees himself as superior to all other people and so cannot relate to anyone.
- to me it is crazy the consequences of a murder in someone's mind,
as discussed many times in the novel, Raskolnikov is correct, he has
the good reasons, but still in the end he doesn't turn himself in 
because of fear of getting caught, he turns himself in because of guilt.
The joy of Raskolnikov kissing the ground (in the end of the book), shows
that us as human beings have an instictive way of write and wrong,
regardless of our own reasoning
- No matter how morally justified he once might have considered his actions, they have devastating collateral effects, harming acknowledged innocents.
- - this is an interesting moral dillema should he feel guilty for killing the sister? It was an accident
- Epilogue
about the reasoning and embrace on a new life
- The growing guilt, to the point that he hides the stolen money and doesn't touch them at all, along with the urge to confess his crimes, are highly typical of criminals.
- - this is very crazy because in fact he the trauma is so big of the murderer that he doesn't even want to take a look at the money
- Why did he kill her?
- - he became Sulky, he says that when he is explaning to Sonya
- - Then I saw, Sonia, that if one waits for 
everyone to get wiser it will take too long.... Afterwards I 
understood that that would never come to pass, that men 
won't change and that nobody can alter it and that it's not 
worth wasting effort over it. Yes, that's so. That's the law 
of their nature, Sonia,... that's so!... And I know now, Sonia, 
that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will have power 
over them. Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their 
eyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver 
among them and he who dares most of all will be most in 
the right! So it has been till now and so it will always be. A 
man must be blind not to see it!"  
Though Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, he 
no longer cared whether she understood or not. The fever 
had complete hold of him; he was in a sort of gloomy 
ecstasy (he certainly had been too long without talking to 
anyone). Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his 
faith and code.  
"I divined then, Sonia," he went on eagerly, "that power 
is only vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick 
it up. There is only one thing, one thing needful: one has 
only to dare! Then for the first time in my life an idea took 
shape in my mind which no one had ever thought of before 
me, no one! I saw clear as daylight how strange it is that 
not a single person living in this mad world has had the 
daring to go straight for it all and send it flying to the 
devil! I... I wanted to have the daring... and I killed her. I 
only wanted to have the daring, Sonia! That was the whole 
cause of it!"
- - Perhaps I should never have committed a murder again. I 
wanted to find out something else; it was something else 
led me on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I 
was a louse like everybody else or a man. Whether I can 
step over barriers or not, whether I dare stoop to pick up 
or not, whether I am a trembling creature or whether I 
have the right..."

## Svidragaliov

![alt text](image-2.png)

Character as a tool to defend christian existentialism
- Dostoevisky uses svidrgaliov as a way to show how bad the consequences of strictly following hedonism
- - Svidrigailov and Raskolnikov both crossed moral lines. Both felt guilty, though Svidrigailov less so. The nightmare he had shows that it still bothered him
- He doesn't rape Dunia
- He kills himself
- He raped a 5 year old, male prostitution
- Essentially, Svidrigailov is someone who embodies Raskolnikov's ideology of the great man who asserts his self will beyond the “prejudice” that is the Christian morality that Russian society at the time ascribed to. Svidrigailov manages to overcome moral boundaries with impunity and without a shred of remorse or hesitation, believing only his self will to be a basis on which to act, and essentially creating his own morals, acting in accordance with his desires.
- We as a society when we look at "terrible" people such as Hitler, we think of them as cold blood that have no regret,
but this character shows to us that deep down even if it is at their subconscious (Svi's dreams with the girl raped) we have a moral because we are all human, not only that
even people like Svi have feelings, at the first time that I read, I remember being astonished by the fact that Svi
doesn't rape Dounia, but now I see that's no surprise because deep down he is also human, and that there is more to
life than strict pleasure, and he manage to feel that with Dounia, and by knowing that he will never be able to feel that again, he decides to kill himself

## Sonya

![alt text](image-1.png)

Epitomization of christ
- Christianity = loves, maximize love in no matter circustance
- She is the epitomization of christ internally, but externally she is just a whore
- Not too sure how accurate my reading of Sonya's character is, but from my understanding she's something of an allegory for Christ. Unconditional love, her position of freedom from bondage, the reception of confessions, and her otherwise unlikely position to be in a genuine caring relationship with someone as misguided as Raskolnikov all seem to point to this
- It is interesting that fact that Sonya is very religious and a prostitute, which is a very big contradiction, and for sure created a lot of suffering for her
- She loves a murderer

- Rodya defended Sonya publicly, and most important is this: Rodya is the only one who does not look down on Sonya, as Sonya is the only one who does not seek to condemn Rodya. Whereas every character contains the seed of blame, and would out Rodya as soon as they learned he murdered the pawnbroker (and her sister!), just as how all of them would dismiss sonya as a prostitute, the couple fully accept and understand one another. They can only find true consolation in one another.

- - We could never a life worthy of God on our own. So Jesus lived a life without sin on our behalf. And then he died the painful death our sins deserve. John 3:17 says, “God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.” By sacrificing himself for us on the cross, he took the punishment for all of our sins at once. This made him the ultimate sacrifice —once and for all satisfying the demands God’s justice required. That is why we call Jesus “Lamb of God.”
- - she was a prostitute just like Maria Madalena was

### Details

Her name
- It is beautiful the fact that her name means reason, when in fact she is not that smart, which shows to us that wisdom is much
more than being smart, she has so much wisdom that she managed to redeem Raskolnikov

## Marmeladov
- very peculiar
- interesting how he is drunk man,
but inside it we can still see vestigios of
the great man he was, specially when he talks


# Symmetries
Perhaps all of thse symmetries in this book are somehow related to hegel

Raskolnikov, Sonya: choose to do crime, forced to do crime (prostitution)
Raskolnikov, Sonya: moral relativist, moral objectivism
Raskolnikov, Sonya: saved her (against Luzhin), saved him from himself
Raskolnikov, Sonya: fully rational/modern, emotional/religious

Raskolnikov, Razumihin: murderer, naive
Raskolnikov, Razumihin: isolated, social
Raskolnikov, Razumihin: lier, honesty

(Svidrigailov, Dunia) (Raskolnikov, Dunia): impure, pure
(Svidrigailov, Dunia) (Raskolnikov, Dunia): sex/blackmail, love

# Topics

Money
- it is interesting the world building that he does, where
we can see how the povery is a kickstart of many problems
and adventures. For example for being poor Dounia has to
work as a servant, and the landlord harasses her but she
can't leave because she is in debt with him, and then
the woman finds out, and she tells the whole town Dounia
is a whore
- it is interesting how much any sight of money brings
happyines to poor people
- it is interesting how much poverty puts constraints into
someone's life,
- - a simple travel by plane they have to do some
math in reach into agreements to make sure that there will
be enough money
- - Dounia wanted to marry a guy that is really bad just for
money


# other

shows the reality of poor people
- interesting how much
money is useful to them
- money is self worth
- alcohol vice
- describing real poverty makes it more sad

One of the main themes I always take away is that humans often like to think that we are logical beings, who make logical decisions for clearly defined reasons, when in reality we are not. As a species we very often act without knowing why we act, and when asked afterward why we did something, we might not know. To me this is demonstrated in the multitude of reasons Raskolnikov gives for killing the woman. There are several reasons, but none of them truly explain why he shed blood. At the end of the day, humans are no more than animals, acting before thinking, and only justifying our action afterwards.

- interesting how a problem can increase to a larger magnitude
specially when you don't talk about it, and you don't confront it
and you are obsessed
- the book is visceral, it shows how much anxiety, stress someone
has to be under to commit the crime, the big problems are added
on top of small details. One of the moments I like the most
is when he is paralylzed of so much stress
- what happens when you have nowhere to turn
