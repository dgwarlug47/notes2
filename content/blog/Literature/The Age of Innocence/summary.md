# Introduction

A hieroglyphic world where the real thing was never said, done, or even thought, but only represented by an arbitrary set of signs.

- First time a woman received the Pulitzer Prize.
- At the time of its release, the book was considered a vain, simple story.
- Like wedding dresses, the novel is often misread as a mere costume drama.
- Explores marriage as an intimate structure crystallizing conflicts between self, custom, and society.
- Stages marriage not as a happy ending but as the beginning of complex life experiences.

### Origin of "Keeping up with the Joneses"

- One explanation ties the phrase to Edith Wharton's father's family, the Joneses, a prominent New York family with substantial interests in Chemical Bank through marriages to the founder's daughters.

- The author had a vain mother who valued social standards.
- Styleness was highly valued in New York society at the time.

# Feminism

- Women were seen as property.
    - The term "Mrs. X" reflects this, implying ownership by "X," while "Miss" highlights marital status as if it were the only important aspect of a woman's identity.
- Children were significant to women, as they were often their only "property."
- The role of women was deeply dependent on men:
    - May had to get pregnant to "convince" Newland to stay, highlighting her lack of agency and reliance on the only "weapon" she hadâ€”sex.

# Status

- New York lacked an aristocracy, unlike Europe. Even prominent families like the Newlands descended from merchants, making high society "new money" in some sense.
- Only three families in the book have royal blood.
- The author refers to high society as "New York," implying the rest of society is irrelevant.

## Politics and Power

- Politics play a significant role in the book:
    - Van der Luyden humiliated those who rejected the invitation to see Ellen Olenska, a powerful and emblematic scene.
- The book highlights how much information can be encoded in actions and words, and how others can interpret them.

# Relationships

- Society values purity in women, but Newland Archer finds it less appealing, which is intriguing.
- The book contrasts the fleeting nature of societal structures:
    - A museum chapter shows the history of other societies, which seem meaningless.
    - In the final chapter, Newland's generation's social structure appears old and irrelevant, reflecting the passage of time.

## Marriage

- Marriage for women serves as protection against other men, who might otherwise pursue them as mistresses.
- The novel subverts the traditional "novel of manners" structure:
    - Instead of ending with a happy marriage, it places marriage in the middle and portrays it as imprisoning, adding a sense of bitter irony to the "happily-ever-after" trope.

# History

- Despite America's growth at the time, it was still viewed as inferior to Europe, particularly in aesthetics.

# Curiosities

- Old-fashioned New York dined at seven.
