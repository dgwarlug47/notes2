# chapter 3

Old Mrs. Mingott was delighted with the engagement, which being long foreseen by watchful relatives, had carefully passed in family council

New York aristocracy seemed to be more conservative than European ones

# chapter 4

Mrs. and Miss Archer were bnoth great lovers of scenery. It was what they principally sought and admired on their occasional travels abroad; considering architecture and painting subjects for men

Mrs. Archer grumbled to Janey, the only witness of her slight lapses from perfect sweetness

Newland Archer keeps defending Ellen Olenska, why? I don't know maybe that means he is a good heart,
and a good nature, or maybe he is already in love with her

Newland Archer finds out that Ellen was living with the secretary which helped she escape from her husband, he seems shocked, and is slowly figuring out that she is not such a nice girl

# chapter 6
Newland Archer has fencers in his library, he is that level of richness

"He reviewed his friends' marriages-thesupposed happy ones-and saw none that answered, even remotely, 
to the passionate and tender comradeship which eh pictured as his permamenent relationship to May Welland"
- the age of innocence, it is very interesting how like many things have changed in society regarding
relationships but some stuff hasn't changed, this idealized vision of marriage still exists

"he saw his marriage becoming what most of what the other marriages were: a dull association of material and social intersects held togeether by ignoracnce on the one side and hypocrisy on the other"

:Forty eight hours altewr the unbelievable happend; every one had refused the mingotts' inviation except the Beauforts and old Mr. Jackson and his sister"
- since New york society is so small, trying to make an excuse that they were unvailable was clearlya lie and a cruel way for them to say that they did not want to see Ellen

# chapter 7

Mrs Archer is cousing of Mrs Henry Van der Luyden

even things very small, as instead of Lawrence going to a party, van nao sei das quantas eh convidado
parece nao so algo importante, mas a coisa mais importante do mundo, lembrando ate um golpe

Ellen Olenska's parents died when she was young, her aunt raised her Medora Manson, who had troubles
with marriage just like the girl she raised.

"But there was about her the mysterious authority of beauty, a sureness in the carriatge of the head, the movement of the eyees, which wihtout being in the least theatrical, stuck  his as highly trained and full of a conscious power."
- Very interesting because she is 30 years old and divorced, and at richest man of New York made a party for her, and she carries herself with this level of confidence. That is very weird

'   It was not the custom in New yoRK DRAWING-ROOMS FOR A LDAY TO GET YUP AND WALK away from one gentelman in order to seek the company of another"
- I can't believe, why would she be interested in Newland

Ellen is very impressive, her behaviour is always different, and unexpected. She is very sexy, what are her intentions, why she is doing that things she does? That is so crazy!!

# chapter 9

"Fashionable! Do you all think so much of that? Why not make one own's fashions? bUT i SUPPOSEE I've lived indepdnetanlty at any rate, I want to do what you all do - I want to feel cared and safe"
- she is an iconoclasta, which is crazy because she was way ahead of its time, today people are iconoclasta to look cool, but she was at a time where it wasn't cool

"It's you who are telling me; opening my eyes to things Ihsf  looked to so long ago that i had ceased to see them"

# chapter 10

"No doubt she simply echoed what was said for her; but she was nearing her twenty-second birhday, and he wondered at what age "nice" women began to speak for themselves"
- muito forte essa frase

Everything May Welland says feels like a performance, which is interesting, because being a fiancee/wife/mom is literrally what she has being trained her whole life, she was groomed to do so

The crazy thing about Ellen is that she is independent, after all the van der luyen did to her, she still keeps behaing innapropately,  which makes the situation more complicated, she doesn't care about
the consequences of her not behaving according to society standards

# chapter 11

Life in New York high society is like a jail, this every constraint of not being able to do anything "unpleasant" is terrible, and Newland is tired of this constrained, he cannot cope with this anymore, because his intelligence makes him see the truth

# chapter 15

at this point Newland already likes Ellen, or has attraction to her, very important to mention

"Madame Olenska, in a burst of irritation, had said to Archer that he and she did not talk the same languagel and the young mamn knew that in some respects this was true."

# chapter 17

"Ah,my dear Mr. Archer, I thank my stars I'm nothing but a vulgar Spicer; but there;s nt one of my own children that takes after me but my little Ellen"

Count olenski wants to have his wife back on her own terms
- "Her portrait has been painted ine times; the greatrest artists in Europe have begged for the privilege"

# chapter 18

"The silence that followed lay on htem with the weight of things final and irrevocable"

Ellen: " I shan't be lonely now. I was lonely; I was afraid. But the  emptiness and the darkness are gone; when I turn back into myself now I'm like a cild going at night int a room where there's always  a light"


Ironically, May convinced her parents to antecipate the wedding, which is funny because that happened at the exact moment where Newland doesn't want to do that anymore.
