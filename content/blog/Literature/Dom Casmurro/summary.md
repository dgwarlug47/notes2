# Capitu
- ENTP
- [MYTAKE] I feel like Capitu is the heart of this book. When she is not in a scene, I don't want to know read it, and whenever she is in the scene I want to read it
- - Perhaps this is the intent of the author, like we want to feel what Bentinho felt, the wait to see Capitu again. For example one of the main parts of the book is the seminario, and that is so fucking boring, oh my god I just wanted that to end
- [MYTAKE] For me what is great about capitu, is that she creates so much tension, her misteriousness creates a tension on the reader that it is compltely insane
- "O que m fascina em Capitu √© a sua maneira de ser, misteriosa, carism√°tica, esquisita, engra√ßada, anti santinha do pau √¥co, mas com uma melancolia chique.'
- - PERFECT
- This girl (Capitu) can drive anyone crazy. She is oblique and dissimulate.
- "Capitu, isto √©, uma criatura muito particular, mais mulher do que eu era homem".
- I think that a big part of the success of Capitu's character comes from the fact that it is very authentic in the sense
even when she was younger, she changed her mind quickly and gave mixed signs for Bento, which is exactly how real-life girls are

# Bentinho
- INFP
- That is a perfect nickname (Dom Casmurro). I must admit, I think it is very "carinhoso" but ironic and gloomy.
- This book invites us to reflect on the circumstances that lead individuals to unhappiness. They weren't always this way; life, with its twists and turns, shapes their fate.
- The transformation from being called Bentinho in his youth to earning the nickname Dom Casmurro in his later years reflects the trajectory of life itself. In our youth, we are full of blessings and vitality, but as we age, we often become consumed by complaints and grievances.
- In youth, life is about exploration and embracing experiences; as we age, it often becomes a journey of being paranoid.

# Great writing
- "Assim, apanhados pela m√£e, √©ramos dois e contr√°rios, ela encobrindo com a palavra o que eu publicava pelo sil√™ncio."
- - KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
- "Mas a vontade aqui foi antes uma id√©ia, uma id√©ia sem l√≠ngua, que se deixou ficar quieta e muda,"
- "Capitu quis que lhe repetisse as respostas todas do agregado, as altera√ß√µes do gesto e at√© a pirueta, que apenas lhe contara. Pedia o som das palavras. Era minuciosa e atenta; a narra√ß√£o e o di√°logo, tudo parecia remoer consigo."
- "Mas eu creio que Capitu olhava para dentro de si mesma, enquanto que eu fitava deveras o ch√£o,"
- "A vida √© cheia de obriga√ß√µes que a gente cumpre, por mais vontade que tenha de as infringir deslavadamente."
- "Que as pernas tambem sao pessoas, apenas inferiores ao bracos, e valem pro si mesmas quando a cabecao nao rege por ideas."
- KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
- "Mas a saudade √© isto mesmo; √© o passar e repassar das mem√≥rias antigas."

# Jeitinho brasileiro
- It is remarkable how old and Brazilian this book is; a promise to make the Bentinho become a priest
- - KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
- - And the worst part, is when they start trading with god the promises to allow him to become an attorney
- Jose dias actually admits who he is: "√© o talento de saber o que √© bom e digno de admira√ß√£o e de apre√ßo"
- - KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK

# Romance
- There is nothing like a good romance, I don't know the words to describe it. Beautiful,¬† poetic, cathartic,
Smooth. There are certain things that only a girl can do to a man, and Capitu is one of them
- It's crazy how much power she has over him, how she can with mannerism looks and gestures completely control a man

## Friends since kids
- The fact that they have known each other since they were kids adds up to the epicness of their romance
- She knew him very well, what the fuck



# Other
Nostalgic
- I don't think this is precisely a considerable merit of the book, but....¬† the fact that this book was passed in 1857 feels enough to make it think it is from a different universe, making it so much vintage.

- It is not Brazilian, Latin American, or poor country-related. But there is this thing which is not exactly pressure, but this force, I don't¬† know how to describe it very well to push the kids to good careers (he does a good job in describing that)

Jealousy
- One of the problems with this part of the story is that there is no major conflict, which we know will come when he suffers a Gaia
- He does a good job introducing jealousy, but Machado doesn't do it in a rush.
- Now, I believe he took way too long to introduce the jealousy.

Loss of romanticism nowadays
- I feel that something, not all, was lost with modernity. We may have lost the romanticism of life. Look at Bentinho; he faked a disease and went to Europe to be with this one girl. Meanwhile, we have Tinder today, in a 5 million city. That sounds absurd.¬†
