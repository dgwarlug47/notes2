## Nickname
- That is a perfect nickname (Dom Casmurro). I must admit, I think it is very "carinhoso" but ironic and gloomy.

## Nostalgic
- I don't think this is precisely a considerable merit of the book, but....  the fact that this book was passed in 1857 feels
enough to make it think it is from a different universe, making it so much vintage.

## Jeitinho brasileiro
- It is remarkable how old and Brazilian this book is; a promise to make the guy become a priest
- KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
- Jose dias actually admits who he is: "é o talento de saber o que é bom e digno de admiração e de apreço"
- - KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK

## Romance
- There is nothing like a good romance, I don't know the words to describe it. Beautiful,  poetic, cathartic,
Smooth. I  don't know the truth; there are certain things that only a girl can do to a man, and Capitu is one of them
- It's crazy how much power she has over him, how she can with mannerism looks and gestures completely control a man

## Great writing
- "Que as pernas tambem sao pessoas, apenas inferiores ao bracos, e valem pro si mesmas quando a cabecao nao rege por ideas."
- KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK

## Friends since kids
- The fact that they have known each other since they were kids adds up to the epicness of their romance
- She knew him very well, what the fuck


## Boring
- Sometimes, he talks about stuff nobody cares about, and I am willing to understand. Fahrenheit
for example, I never had that
- One of the main problems of this book is that the main topic is not that interesting. I must admit the romance is nice, but Bento coming out of the Seminario is not a big deal


## Capitu is the center of the book
- I feel like Capitu is the heart of this book. When she is not in a scene, I don't want to know about it, and she is great
- Perhaps this is the intent of the author, like we want to feel what Bentinho felt, the wait to see Capitu again
- For the time she was living, she was quite a strong character, self-determined,  and owned her destiny.
- This girl (Capitu) can drive anyone crazy. She is oblique and dissimulate.
- I think that a big part of the success of Capita's character comes from the fact that it is very authentic in the sense
even when she was younger, she changed her mind quickly and gave mixed signs for Bento, which is exactly how real-life girls are
- "O que m fascina em Capitu é a sua maneira de ser, misteriosa, carismática, esquisita, engraçada, anti santinha do pau ôco, mas com uma melancolia chique.'
- "Capitu, isto é, uma criatura mui particular, mais mulher do que eu era homem".
- For me what is great about capitu, is that she is simply so tense, her misteriousness creates a tension on the reader that it is compltely insane

## Machado really has the ability to say things in the most stylistic way
- "Assim, apanhados pela mãe, éramos dois e contrários, ela encobrindo com a palavra o que eu publicava pelo silêncio."
- - KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
- "Mas a vontade aqui foi antes uma idéia, uma idéia sem língua, que se deixou ficar quieta e muda,"
- "Capitu quis que lhe repetisse as respostas todas do agregado, as alterações do gesto e até a pirueta, que apenas lhe contara. Pedia o som das palavras. Era minuciosa e atenta; a narração e o diálogo, tudo parecia remoer consigo."

It is not Brazilian, Latin American, or poor country-related. But there is this thing which is not exactly pressure,
but this force, I don't  know how to describe it very well to push the kids to good careers (he does a good job in describing those)

"Mas eu creio que Capitu olhava para dentro de si mesma, enquanto que eu fitava deveras o chão,"

As I said, this guy created Capitu perfectly; asking this when she told reveals the worst about Capitu.
can bring, and woman in general: "Se você tivesse de escolher entre mim e sua mãe, a quem é que escolhia?

"Há nisto alguma exageração; mas é bom ser enfático, uma ou outra vez, para compensar este escrúpulo de exatidão que me aflige."

Jealous
- One of the problems with this part of the story is that there is no major conflict, which we know will come when he suffers a Gaia
- He does a good job introducing jealousy, but Machado doesn't do it in a rush.
- Now, I believe he took way too long to introduce the jealousy.

Loss of romanticism
- I feel that something, not all, was lost with modernity. We may have lost the romanticism of life. Look at Bentinho; he faked a disease and went to Europe to be with this one girl. Meanwhile, we have Tinder today, in a 5 million city. That sounds absurd.
