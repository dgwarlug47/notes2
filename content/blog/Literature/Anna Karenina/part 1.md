Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in it's own way

Every person in hte house felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that the stray people brought toegether by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they, the members of the family and hosehould of the oblonsky's

"Ah, ah, ah! OO!..." he muttered, reaclling everything that had happened. And again every detail of this quarrel with this wife was present to his imagination, all the hopelessness of his position, and worst of all, his own fault."

"But what's to be done? What's to be done? What's to be done?" he said to himnself in despair and found no answer.

He had even supposed that she, a worn-out woman no longer young or good-looking, and in no way remarkable or interesting, merely a good mother, ought from a sense of fainess to take an indulgent view. It had turned out quite the other way.

Stepan Arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views; these
political opinions and views had come to him of themselves, just as he did not
choose the shapes of his hat and coat, but simply took those that were being worn.

She still continued to tell herself that she should leave
him, but she was conscious that this was impossible; it was impossible because
she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as her husband and loving
him.

“Dolly!” he said in a subdued and timid voice. He bent his head towards his
shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble, but for all that he was radiant with
freshness and health.

# Chapter 5

This post he
had received through his sister Anna’s husband, Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin,
who held one of the most important positions in the ministry to whose department
the Moscow office belonged. But if Karenina had not got his brother-in-law this
berth, then through a hundred other personages—brothers, sister, cousins, uncles,
and aunts—Stiva Oblonsky would have received this post, or some other similar one.

Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had long known that Levin was in love with his
sister-in-law, Kitty, gave a hardly perceptible smile, and his eyes sparkled merrily.

# Chapter 6

When Oblonsky asked Levin what had brought him to town, Levin blushed,
and was furious with himself for blushing, because he could not answer, “I
have come to make your sister-in-law an offer,” though that was precisely what he
had come for.

But Levin was in love, and so it seemed
to him that Kitty was so perfect in every respect that she was a creature far above
everything earthly; and that he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could
not even be conceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy
of her

# Chapter 9

But for Levin she
was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettles. Everything was made
bright by her. She was the smile that shed light on all round her. 

ng to Levin. She was more splendid that he had imagined her.
When he thought of her, he could call up a vivid picture of her to himself,
especially the charm of that little fair head, so freely set on the shapely girlish
shoulders, and so full of childish brightness and good-humor. The childishness of
her expression, together with the delicate beauty of her figure, made up her special
charm, and that he fully realized.

“Maybe. But still it’s queer to me, just as at this moment it seems queer to me
that we country folks try to get our meals over as soon as we can, so as to be ready
for our work, while here are we trying to drag out our meal as long as possible,
and with that object eating oysters. . . ”
“Why, of course,” objected Stepan Arkadyevitch. “But that’s just the aim of
civilization—to make everything a source of enjoyment.”
“Well, if that’s its aim, I’d rather be a savage.”

# Chapter 11

“Vronsky is one of the sons of Count Kirill Ivanovitch Vronsky, and one of
the finest specimens of the gilded youth of Petersburg. I made his acquaintance in
Tver when I was there on official business, and he came there for the levy of recruits. Fearfully rich, handsome, great connections, an aide-de-camp, and with all
that a very nice, good-natured fellow. But he’s more than simply a good-natured
fellow, as I’ve found out here—he’s a cultivated man, too, and very intelligent; he
a man who’ll make his mark.”

"But women, my boy, they'are the pivot everything turns upon."

“It’s very well for you to talk like that; it’s very much like that gentleman in
Dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his right shoulder. But to
deny the facts is no answer. What’s to be done—you tell me that, what’s to be
done? Your wife gets older, while you’re full of life. Before you’ve time to look
round, you feel that you can’t love your wife with love, however much you may
esteem her. And then all at once love turns up, and you’re done for, done for,”
Stepan Arkadyevitch said with weary despair.

# Chapter 15

 It was Levin’s face, with his scowling brows, and his
kind eyes looking out in dark dejection below them, as he stood listening to her
father, and glancing at her and at Vronsky. And she felt so sorry for him that
tears came into her eyes. But immediately she thought of the man for whom she
had given him up.

# Chapter 16

VRONSKY had never had a real home life. His mother had been in her youth a
brilliant society woman, who had had during her married life, and still more
afterwards, many love affairs notorious in the whole fashionable world. His father
he scarcely remembered, and he had been educated in the Corps of Pages.

# Chapter 17

Vronsky, standing beside Oblonsky, watched the carriages and the passengers,
totally oblivious of this mother. What he had just heard about Kitty excited and
delighted him. Unconsciously he arched his chest, and his eyes flashed. He felt
himself a conqueror.

# Chapter 19

“She’s young, you see, she’s pretty,” she went on. “Do you know, Anna, my
youth and my beauty are gone, taken by whom? By him and his children. I have
worked for him, and all I had has gone in his service, and now of course any fresh,
vulgar creature has more charm for him. No doubt they talked of me together, or,
worse still, they were silent. Do you understand?”

# Chapter 27

The house was big and old-fashioned, and Levin, though he lived alone, had
the whole house heated and used. He knew that this was stupid, he knew that
it was positively not right, and contrary to his present new plans, but this house
was a whole world to Levin. It was the world in which his father and mother
had lived and died. They had lived just the life that to Levin seemed the ideal of
perfection, and that he had dreamed of beginning with his wife, his family.

He was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage that
he positively pictured to himself first the family, and only secondarily the woman
who would give him a family. His ideas of marriage were, consequently, quite
unlike those of the great majority of his acquaintances, for whom getting married
was one of the numerous facts of social life. For Levin it was the chief affair of
life, on which its whole happiness turned. And now he had to give up that.

He was reading a book, and thinking of what he was
reading, and stopping to listen to Agafea Mihalovna, who gossiped away without
flagging, and yet with all that, all sorts of pictures of family life and work in the
future rose disconnectedly before his imagination. He felt that in the depth of his
soul something had been put in its place, settled down, and laid to rest.

He took up his book again. “Very good, electricity and heat are the same thing;
but is it possible to substitute the one quantity for the other in the equation for the
solution of any problem? No. Well, then what of it? The connection between all
the forces of nature is felt instinctively. . . It’s particularly nice if Pava’s daughter
should be a red-spotted cow, and all the herd will take after her, and the other
three, too! Splendid!

# Chapter 29

If she read that the heroine of the novel was nursing a
sick man, she longed to move with noiseless steps about the room of a sick man; if
she read of a member of Parliament making a speech, she longed to be delivering
the speech; if she read of how Lady Mary had ridden after the hounds, and had
provoked her sister-in-law, and had surprised every one by her boldness, she too
wished to be doing the same. But there was no chance of doing anything; and
twisting the smooth paper knife in her little hands, she forced herself to read.

# Chapter 30 

She looked round, and the same instant recognized Vronsky’s face

“What am I coming for?” he repeated, looking straight into her eyes. “You
know that I have come to be where you are,” he said; “I can’t help it.”

Though she could not recall her own words or his, she realized instinctively
that the momentary conversation had brought them fearfully closer; and she was
panic-stricken and blissful at it.

# Chapter 31

He knew only that he had told her the truth, that he had come where she was, that
all the happiness of his life, the only meaning in life for him, now lay in seeing
and hearing her. And when he got out of the carriage at Bologova to get some
seltzer water, and caught sight of Anna, involuntarily his first word had told her
just what he thought. And he was glad he had told her it, that she knew it now and
was thinking of it. He did not sleep all night.

# Chapter 32

And her son, like her husband, aroused in Anna a feeling akin to disappointment. She had imagined him better than he was in reality. She had to let herself
drop down to the reality to enjoy him as he really was.

# Chapter 33

ALEXEY Alexandrovitch came back from the meeting of the ministers at four
o’clock, but as often happened, he had not time no come in to her. He went
into his study to see the people waiting for him with petitions, and to sign some
papers brought him by his chief secretary.

“Unhasting and unresting,”
was his motto. He came into the dining hall, greeted everyone, and hurriedly sat
down, smiling to his wife.

# Chapter 34 

You see, I’m engrossed
with business! I want a lawsuit, because I must have my property. Do you understand the folly of it, that on the pretext of my being unfaithful to him,” she said
contemptuously, “he wants to get the benefit of my fortune.”

This was the class of old-fashioned and ridiculous people. But there
was another class of people, the real people. To this class they all belonged, and
in it the great thing was to be elegant, generous, plucky, gay, to abandon oneself
without a blush to every passion, and to laugh at everything else.
