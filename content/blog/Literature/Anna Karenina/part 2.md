# Chapter 4

The highest Petersburg society is essentially one: in it every one knows every one else, every one even visits every one else. but this great set has its
subdivisions. Anna Arkadyevna Karenina had friends and close ties in three different circles of this highest society.

Her connection with this circle was kept up through Princess Betsy Tverskaya,
her cousin’s wife, who had an income of a hundred and twenty thousand roubles, and who had taken a great fancy to Anna ever since she first came out,
showed her much attention, and drew her into her set, making fun of Countess
Lidia Ivanovna’s coterie.

Anna had at first avoided as far as she could Princess Tverskaya’s world, because it necessitated an expenditure beyond her means, and besides in her heart
she preferred the first circle. But since her visit to Moscow she had done quite
the contrary. She avoided her serious-minded friends, and went out into the fashionable world. There she met Vronsky, and experienced an agitating joy at those
meetings.

He was very well aware that he ran no risk of being ridiculous in the eyes of
Betsy or any other fashionable people. He was very well aware that in their eyes
the position of an unsuccessful lover of a girl, or of any woman free to marry,
might be ridiculous. But the position of a man pursuing a married woman, and,
regardless of everything, staking his life on drawing her into adultery, has something fine and grand about it, and can never be ridiculous; and so it was with
a proud and gay smile under his mustaches that he lowered the opera glass and
looked at his cousin.

The conversation began amiably, but just because it was too amiable, it came
to a stop again. They had to have recourse to the sure, never-failing topic—gossip.

The sensation produced by Princess Myakaya’s speeches was always unique,
and the secret of the sensation she produced lay in the fact that though she spoke
not always appropriately, as now, she said simple things with some sense in them.
In the society in which she lived such plain statements produced the effect of the
wittiest epigram. Princess Myakaya could never see why it had that effect, but she
knew it had, and took advantage of it.

# Chapter 7 

She was standing holding herself, as always, very erect, and when Kitty drew
near the group she was speaking to the master of the house, her head slightly
turned towards him.

# Chapter 8

ALEXEY Alexandrovitch had seen nothing striking or improper in the fact that
his wife was sitting with Vronsky at a table apart, in eager conversation with
him about something. But he noticed that to the rest of the party this appeared
something striking and improper, and for that reason it seemed to him too to be
improper. He made up his mind that he must speak of it to his wife.

Thinking over what he would
say, he somewhat regretted that he should have to use his time and mental powers
for domestic consumption, with so little to show for it, but, in spite of that, the
form and contents of the speech before him shaped itself as clearly and distinctly
in his head as a ministerial report.

For an instant her face fell, and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away; but
the word love threw her into revolt again. She thought: “Love? Can he love? If he
hadn’t heard there was such a thing as love, he would never have used the word.
He doesn’t even know what love is.”''

# Chapter 11

THAT which for Vronsky had been almost a whole year the one absorbing desire of his life, replacing all his old desires; that which for Anna had been an
impossible, terrible, and even for that reason more entrancing dream of bliss, that
desire had been fulfilled. He stood before her, pale, his lower jaw quivering, and
besought her to be calm, not knowing how or why.
“Anna! Anna!” he said with a choking voice, “Anna, for pity’s sake!. . . ”
But the louder he spoke, the lower she dropped her once proud and gay, now
shame-stricken head, and she bowed down and sank from the sofa where she was
sitting, down on the floor, at his feed; she would have fallen on the carpet if he
had not held her.
“My God! Forgive me!” she said, sobbing, pressing his hands to her bosom.

# Chapter 12

But three months had passed and he had not left off minding about it; and it
was as painful for him to think of it as it had been those first days. He could not
be at peace because after dreaming so long of family life, and feeling himself so
ripe for it, he was still not married, and was further than ever from marriage. He
was painfully conscious himself, as were all about him, that at his years it is not
well for man to be alone. 

With her indeed he not infrequently fell
into discussion upon physics, the theory of agriculture, and especially philosophy;
philosophy was Agafea Mihalovna’s favorite subject.

# Chapter 14

Levin listened in silence, and in spite of all the efforts he made, he could not
in the least enter into the feeling of his friend and understand his sentiments and
the charm of studying such women.

# Chapter 15

“Oh, well, the higher power of Ryabinin can. Not a single merchant ever buys
a forest without counting the trees, unless they get it given them for nothing, as
you’re doing now. I know your forest. I go there every year shooting, and your
forest’s worth a hundred and fifty roubles and acre paid down, while he’s giving
you sixty by installments. So that in fact you’re making him a present of thirty
thousand.”

# Chapter 17

The business of the
forest was over, the money in his pocket; their shooting had been excellent, and
Stepan Arkadyevitch was in the happiest frame of mind, and so he felt specially
anxious to dissipate the ill-humor that had come upon Levin. He wanted to finish
the day at supper as pleasantly as it had been begun.

“No; I don’t know whether you know it or not, but I don’t care. And I tell
you—I did make an offer and was rejected, and Katerina Alexandrovna is nothing
now to me but a painful and humiliating reminiscence.”

# Chapter 21

“Yes, she was unhappy before, but proud and at peace; and now she cannot be
at peace and feel secure in her dignity, though she does not show it. Yes, we must
put an end to it,” he decided.

# Chapter 22

“But you’re ill or worried,” he went on, not letting go her hands and bending
over her. “What were you thinking of?”
“Always the same thing,” she said, with a smile.
She spoke the truth. If ever at any moment she had been asked what she was
thinking of, she could have answered truly: of the same thing, of her happiness and
her unhappiness.

# Chapter 23

That’s what will
happen. He’s not a man, but a machine, and a spiteful machine when he’s angry,”

“I unhappy?” she said, coming closer to him, and looking at him with an
ecstatic smile of love. “I am like a hungry man who has been given food. He may
be cold, and dressed in rags, and ashamed, but he is not unhappy. I unhappy? No,
this is my unhappiness. . . .

# Chapter 24

The Tsar and the
whole court and crowds of people were all gazing at them—at him, and Mahotin
a length ahead of him, as they drew near the “devil,” as the solid barrier was
called.

All at once
his position had shifted and he knew that something awful had happened. He
could not yet make out what had happened, when the white legs of a chestnut
horse flashed by close to him, and Mahotin passed at a swift gallop. Vronsky was
touching the ground with one foot, and his mare was sinking on that foot. He
just had time to free his leg when she fell on one side, gasping painfully, and,
making vain efforts to rise with her delicate, soaking neck, she Buttered on the
ground at his feet like a shot bird. The clumsy movement made by Vronsky had
broken her back. But that he only knew much later. At that moment he knew
only that Mahotin had down swiftly by, while he stood staggering alone on the
muddy, motionless ground, and Frou-Frou lay gasping before him, bending herhead back and gazing at him with her exquisite eyes.

# Chapter 26

The external relations of Alexey Alexandrovitch and his wife had remained unchanged. The sole difference lay in the fact that he was more busily occupied than ever.

He did not realize it, because it was too terrible to him to realize his actual position, and he shut down and locked and sealed up in his heart that secret place where lay hid his feelings towards his family, that is, his wife and son. He who had been such a careful father, had from the end of that winter become peculiarly frigid to his son, and adopted to him just the same bantering tone he used with his wife. “Aha, young man!” was the greeting with which he met him.
