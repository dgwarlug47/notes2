# Chapter 1

"Gosto disso! que se enganem. Eh a unica superioridade
dos homens sobre os outros seres. Eh assim que se chega
a verdade. Sou homem, e me engano porque sou homem. Nao
se chega a nenhuma verdade sem nos enganarmos pelo menos
quatorze vezes...."

"Um erro original vale muito mais do que uma verdade banal"

"Todos, todos sem excecao eh o que lhes digo, nos achamos
no que se refere a ciencia, a cultura, ao pensamento ...
numa classe prepartoria de liceu e contentamo-nos de viver
com o espirito dos outros"

either the mother or the sister's response: "Oh, meu Deus,
nao sei de nada!"

At this stage I think Raskolnikov is very weak, imagine how
much stress he has been through, now imagine how much burden
his mother is going through

Razumíkhin fell in love at first sight by Dounia

"Quando pensa que ele esta apressado e todo mundo o incomoda,
ele fica entretato deitado sem fazer coisa nenhuma"

"Entretanto, essa pobreza ostensiva, de usa aparencia dava, 
as duas, um ar de diginidade especial, como acontence, em regra,
com os que sabem usa as coisas humildes"

# Chapter 2

" Sentia que tal convivio - essa mae, essa
irma que revia, apos tres anos de sepracao,
esse tom familiar, intimo, da conversacao, 
quando ele se achava num estado de incapacidade
para falar o que quer que fosse - estava a ponto
de ficar insuportavel
- lembra vovo carminha

"Corou e um clarao de colera, brilhou-lhe nos
olhos. - Realizaras turdo? perguntou com um
sorrizo mordaz"
- this guy is becoming a psicopath

"Piotr Petrovitch nao pretende esconder que
recebeu pouca instrucao e ate se orgulha por ser
fruto do proprio esforco, observou Avdotia Romanovan,
magoada com a atitude que o irmao tomava"

# Chapter 3

askolnikov was 
sitting in the opposite corner, fully dressed and carefully 
washed and combed, as he had not been for some time 
past.
- that's very weird, I have never seen him like this

Raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with 
his condition the day before, but he was still pale, listless, 
and sombre. He looked like a wounded man or one who 
has undergone some terrible physical suffering. His brows 
were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He 
spoke little and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, 
and there was a restlessness in his movements. 
- once again we see the punishment of crime and punishment

Zossimov, watching and studying 
his patient with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to 
practise, noticed in him no joy at the arrival of his mother 
and sister, but a sort of bitter, hidden determination to 
bear another hour or two of inevitable torture.
- interesting how everything in his life even the presence
of his mom and daughter became a suffering

Zossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to 
make an effect before the ladies, was certainly somewhat 
mystified,  when,  glancing  at  his  patient,  he  observed 
unmistakable mockery on his face.
- this is very unexpected and scary, he is obviously turning
into a psycopath, it's funny how killing someone make you
not care about anything, he feels free from social norms
and good sense

What  generous  impulses  he  has,  and  how 
simply,  how  delicately  he  put  an  end  to  all  the 
misunderstanding with his sister—simply by holding out 
his hand at the right minute and looking at her like that....
- right now I don't know if this is the good side he still
owns or already a machiavelic manipulation

"That's enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you 
do is very good," said his mother, delighted.  
"Don't be too sure," he answered, twisting his mouth 
into a smile.  
A silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all 
this  conversation,  and  in  the  silence,  and  in  the 
reconciliation, and in the forgiveness, and all were feeling 
it.
- very interesting of not following the dynamics of the social
norms, by doing so, the clima becomes very weird, specially
because people don't know how to react

"Do  you  know,  Rodya,  Marfa  Petrovna  is  dead," 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna suddenly blurted out.

"Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was 
always very patient, considerate even. In fact, all those 
seven years of their married life he gave way to her, too 
much so indeed, in many cases. All of a sudden he seems to 
have lost patience."
- interesing the non linearity of human behaviour, as 
described in every single book from Taleb

"Why,  are  you  all  afraid  of  me?"  he  asked,  with  a 
constrained smile.
- completely sem vergonha

Again that awful sensation he 
had known of late passed with deadly chill over his soul. 
Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to him 
that he had just told a fearful lie—that he would never 
now be able to speak freely of everything—that he would 
never again be able to speak of anything to anyone. The 
anguish of this thought was such that for a moment he 
almost forgot himself. He got up from his seat, and not 
looking at anyone walked towards the door.
- very dramatic and intense, once again we see a new form
of punishment, this book should be called one crime, a
million punishments

"Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday 
was  beginning  again,"  said  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna, 
crossing herself.


I do not withdraw from my chief 
point. It is me or Luzhin. If I am a scoundrel, you must not 
be. One is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease at once to 
look on you as a sister."
- ele eh muito teimoso

Raskolnikov said: In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander me 
and to raise dissension between us. It is expressed again in 
legal jargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the 
aim, and with a very naïve eagerness. He is a man of 
intelligence, but to act sensibly, intelligence is not enough.
- Luzin is underestimating his oponent

# Chapter 4

At that moment the door was softly opened, and a 
young girl walked into the room, looking timidly about 
her.  Everyone  turned  towards  her  with  surprise  and  
curiosity. At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise her. 
It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov

Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she 
was  not  so  much  embarrassed  as  completely 
overwhelmed with shyness, like a little child.
- oh my god life is very hard, imagine someone
like her to be prositutue, the only think I can
infer is that whenever she is having sex with
her clients it must be very painful to her

All this passed 
vaguely and fleetingly through his brain, but looking at her 
more intently, he saw that the humiliated creature was so 
humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her. When she 
made a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his 
heart.
- parabens

In spite of her 
eighteen years, she looked almost a little girl—almost a 
child.  And  in  some  of  her  gestures,  this  childishness  
seemed almost absurd.
- so a murderer is going to marry an innocent child

You  gave  us  everything  yesterday,"  Sonia  said 
suddenly, in reply, in a loud rapid whisper; and again she 
looked  down  in  confusion.  Her  lips  and  chin  were 
trembling once more. She had been struck at once by 
Raskolnikov's poor surroundings, and now these words 
broke out spontaneously.
- this story brings to much anxiety and perplexity to
the audience, because there is something wrong with
Raskolnikov, which explains all his weirdness, and
since they don't know about that everything seems
surprisings

Do you 
know, Dounia, I was looking at you two. You are the very 
portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul. You are 
both melancholy, both morose and hot‐tempered, both 
haughty and both generous....
- incompatibilidade de gemeos

"I have a presentiment, Dounia. Well, you may believe it 
or not, but as soon as she came in, that very minute, I felt 
that she was the chief cause of the trouble...."
- it's crazy the motherly instinct

"And  Pyotr  Petrovitch  is  a  contemptible  slanderer," 
Dounia snapped out, suddenly.

He was inquiring for people who had pawned things, 
and I have some pledges there, too—trifles—a ring my 
sister gave me as a keepsake when I left home
- if the people around him look closely, every moment
he is giving hints about being involved in the murder

"If  you  have  to  go  now,"  Sonia  was  beginning,  not 
looking at Razumihin at all, and still more embarrassed.
- oh my god this is ridiculous she is still embarassed

She  was  not  capable  at  that  instant  of  noticing  an 
unknown gentleman who was watching her and following 
at her heels.
- damn it, that's crazy, that's so crazy

He had a broad, rather 
pleasant face with high cheek‐bones and a fresh colour, 
not often seen in Petersburg.
- interesting introduction of the character, we are hearing
about him before knowing who is him, which adds mystery

How the fuck this guy lives closes to sonya and wears good and
fashionable clothes

"We are neighbours," he went on gaily. "I only came to 
town the day before yesterday. Good‐bye for the present."  
Sonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped 
in. She felt for some reason ashamed and uneasy.
- who is this guy?

He is an intelligent fellow, very much so 
indeed,  but  he  has  his  own  range  of  ideas....  He  is 
incredulous,  sceptical,  cynical...  he  likes  to  impose  on 
people, or rather to make fun of them
- Porfiry seems like a bad guy

 Last year he cleared up a case of murder in 
which the police had hardly a clue. He is very, very anxious 
to make your acquaintance!
- this makes me feel interested about their meeting,
because thy are both smart like just like L and kira

Both were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic 
and  Raskolnikov  perceived  it  with  repulsion.
- Razumihin is a very positive guy, he sees everything
as something good

"Listen, listen, listen, this is serious.... What next, you 
fiend!" Razumihin was utterly overwhelmed, turning cold 
with horror. "What will you tell them? Come, brother... foo! 
what a pig you are!"
- damn he really fell in love very quickly by Dounia, it was
love at first sight, I think falling in love at first sight
it is very much like Razumihin personality you know? He is
a bit impulsive

"You are like a summer rose. And if only you knew how 
it suits you; a Romeo over six foot high! And how you've 
washed  to‐day—you  cleaned  your  nails,  I  declare.  Eh? 
That's something unheard of! Why, I do believe you've got 
pomatum on your hair! Bend down."
- I don't think Rashkolnikov would be a bully before the
accident, in some way he got better after the murder

# Chapter 5

"There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he 
is so furious at the word," Porfiry laughed.
- he doesn't seem like such a bad guy after all

carefully 
making his voice tremble, "that the watch was lost, she 
would be in despair! You know what women are!"
- Raskolnikov really is changing, he is even becoming an
actor

"I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great 
distress about something. You look pale still."
- damn it, it's very obvious that is clearly a potential
candidate of the murderer

"What next! 
He was unconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would 
you believe, Porfiry, as soon as our backs were turned, he 
dressed, though he could hardly stand, and gave us the slip 
and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight, delirious 
all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!"
- Ramuzhini really doesn't help

"And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to‐day," put in 
Porfiry Petrovitch, "that he met you very late last night in 
the lodging of a man who had been run over."

"Come, strike me openly, don't play with me like 
a cat with a mouse. It's hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but 
perhaps I won't allow it! I shall get up and throw the 
whole truth in your ugly faces, and you'll see how I despise 
you." He could hardly breathe.
- interestig because most people would be fear of being
discovered, but he becomes angry, showig another side
of psycopathy

Razumihin is sitting 
here, why does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead 
never does see anything!
- he really is a metaphor for good in this book, in
a certain way

I  am  not  wrong.  I'll  show  you  their  pamphlets. 
Everything with them is 'the influence of environment,' 
and nothing else. Their favourite phrase! From which it 
follows that, if society is normally organised, all crime will 
cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest against 
and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human 
nature is not taken into account, it is excluded, it's not 
supposed to exist!
- very interesting how old this debate is

That's 
why they so dislike the living process of life; they don't 
want a living soul! The living soul demands life, the soul 
won't obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of 
suspicion,  the  soul  is  retrograde!
- very interesting, sometimes we forgot the intersection
between socialism and brave new world

The phalanstery is ready, indeed, but 
your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery—it 
wants life, it hasn't completed its vital process, it's too 
soon for the graveyard

 Logic presupposes three possibilities, but there are 
millions!  Cut  away  a  million,  and  reduce  it  all  to  the  
question of comfort! That's the  easiest solution of the 
problem! It's seductively clear and you musn't think about 
it. That's the great thing, you mustn't think! The whole 
secret of life in two pages of print!"

"Oh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty 
violates a child of ten; was it environment drove him to 
it?"  
"Well, strictly speaking, it did," Porfiry observed with 
noteworthy gravity; "a crime of that nature may be very 
well ascribed to the influence of environment."
- this is an interesting question, I wouldn't know the
answer

Last year he persuaded us that he was going into 
a monastery: he stuck to it for two months.
- interestig how the simple jokes and fooling around
can show the great strengths of the enemy

in the article Raskolnikov : "I analysed, 
if I remember, the psychology of a criminal 
before and after the crime."
- damn so many hints, and no proof

There  is,  if  you  recollect,  a 
suggestion that there are certain persons who can... that is, 
not  precisely  are  able  to,  but  have  a  perfect  right  to  
commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the law 
is not for them.
- this is a key theory in the book apparently

I maintain that if the discoveries of 
Kepler and Newton could not have been made known 
except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a hundred, 
or more men, Newton would have had the right, would 
indeed have been in duty bound... to eliminate the dozen 
or the hundred men for the sake of making his discoveries 
known to the whole of humanity.

I only believe in my 
leading idea that men are in general divided by a law of 
nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so 
to say, material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and 
men who have the gift or the talent to utter a new word.

The second 
category all transgress the law; they are destroyers or 
disposed to destruction according to their capacities. The 
crimes of these men are of course relative and varied; for 
the  most  part  they  seek  in  very  varied  ways  the 
destruction of the present for the sake of the better.
- this somehow makes me think about a communist revolution
because some people are entitled to make a crime in order
to bring something new to life

The first 
category is always the man of the present, the second the 
man of the future. The first preserve the world and people 
it, the second move the world and lead it to its goal

"And... and do you believe in God? Excuse my curiosity."  
"I do," repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry.
- is this true? If that's the case then he must really
believe that killing that old lady was moral?

The vast mass of mankind is 
mere material, and only exists in order by some great 
effort, by some mysterious process, by means of some 
crossing of races and stocks, to bring into the world at last 
perhaps  one  man  out  of  a  thousand  with  a  spark  of 
independence.  One  in  ten  thousand  perhaps—I  speak 
roughly, approximately—is born with some independence, 
and  with  still  greater  independence  one  in  a  hundred 
thousand. The man of genius is one of millions, and the 
great geniuses, the crown of humanity, appear on earth 
perhaps one in many thousand millions.

"Well, you see... I really don't know how to express it 
properly.... It's a playful, psychological idea.... When you 
were writing your article, surely you couldn't have helped, 
he‐he! fancying yourself... just a little, an 'extraordinary' 
man, uttering a new word in your sense.... That's so, isn't 
it?"  
"Quite  possibly,"  Raskolnikov  answered 
contemptuously.
- after Raskolnikov commited his crime, he will not lie about
anything related to his own dignity

"Perhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did 
for Alyona Ivanovna last week?" Zametov blurted out from 
the corner.
- very intersted that Zametov said about the elephant
in the room, that reveals a lot about his character
that he is the type of person that talks about things
and has no fear

Raskolnikov  did  not  speak,  but  looked  firmly  and 
intently at Porfiry. Razumihin was scowling gloomily. He 
seemed before this to be noticing something. He looked 
angrily around. There was a minute of gloomy silence. 
Raskolnikov turned to go.
- this is the worst reaction possible, I have no idea
how someone smart such as Raskolnikov could do something
like this

# Chapter 6

"You are suspicious. That is why you weighed their 
words... h'm... certainly, I agree, Porfiry's tone was rather 
strange, and still more that wretch Zametov!... You are 
right, there was something about him—but why? Why?"  
"He has changed his mind since last night."
- curious to know what changed about zametov

The more cunning a man is, 
the less he suspects that he will be caught in a simple 
thing. The more cunning a man is, the simpler the trap he 
must be caught in. Porfiry is not such a fool as you think....

His 
ideas  were  all  tangled.  He  went  dreamily  through  the 
gateway. 

"You  were  inquiring  for  me...  of  the  porter?" 
Raskolnikov said at last, but in a curiously quiet voice.  
The man made no answer; he didn't even look at him. 
Again they were both silent.
- this guy is clearly a bad ass

"Murderer!" he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and 
distinct voice.  
Raskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt 
suddenly weak, a cold shiver ran down his spine, and his 
heart seemed to stand still for a moment, then suddenly 
began throbbing as though it were set free. So they walked 
for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.
- this was very well done for many reasons, first because
he hid the word in the next page, second because it was
totally unexpected since we don't even know who that person
is, and clearly things are getting more serious for Raskolnikov
since he is on the spotlight

Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied 
that he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred 
and triumph.
- clearly this guy is a psycopath as well, and has reasons
to have Raskolinikov, which is very interesting

With  slow  faltering  steps,  with  shaking  knees, 
Raskolnikov made his way back to his little garret, feeling 
chilled all over. He took off his cap and put it on the table, 
and for ten minutes he stood without moving.
- he creates some very dramatic scenes

"No, those men are not made so. The real Master to 
whom all is permitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in 
Paris, forgets an army in Egypt, wastes half a million men 
in the Moscow expedition and gets off with a jest at Vilna. 
And altars are set up to him after his death, and so all is 
permitted. No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but of 
bronze!"
- I am really surprised that he thinks so highly of himself,
that is so weird

"A velha nao significa nada, dizia a si mesmo, ardente impetuosamente.
Eh talvez um erro, mas nao se tradta dela. A velha foi senao um acidente
.. eu queria dar um pulo depressa. Nao matei um ser humano, mas sim
um principio"

the guy that said he was a murderer took him to the building where
the murder happened, Raskolinkov is quite stupid sometimes
