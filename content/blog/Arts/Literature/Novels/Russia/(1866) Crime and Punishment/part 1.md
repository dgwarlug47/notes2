# Chapter 1

And each time he passed, the 
young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him 
scowl and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his 
landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.
- from the very beginning we can see he is disturbed
- also he seems to be always disturbed

This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite 
the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an 
overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria.
- the author is trying to put him as a nice guy, so basically
his money is not his fault

From time to time, he would 
mutter something, from the habit of talking to himself, to 
which he had just confessed. At these moments he would 
become  conscious  that  his  ideas  were  sometimes  in  a  
tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had 
scarcely tasted food.

Why, it's just such trifles 
that always ruin everything...." 

He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it 
was from the gate of his lodging house: exactly seven 
hundred and thirty. He had counted them once when he 
had been lost in dreams.
- very obsessed about this plan, this shows how much
you have to plan and think about before doing something
bad such as killing. "tomar coragem", is about normalizing
something abnormal

the old woman eyed her visitor with evident 
distrust through the crack, and nothing could be seen but 
her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.

But no 
words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The 
feeling of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress 
and torture his heart while he was on his way to the old 
woman, had by now reached such a pitch and had taken 
such a definite form that he did not know what to do with 
himself to escape from his wretchedness.

# Chapter 2

Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said 
before, he avoided society of every sort, more especially of 
late.

He was 
so  weary  after  a  whole  month  of  concentrated  
wretchedness and gloomy excitement that he longed to 
rest, if only for a moment, in some other world
- very accurate description
- my theory is that given what happened, the author
simply writes in the most accurate way possible, that's
it

The master of the establishment was in another room, 
but he frequently came down some steps into the main 
room, his jaunty, tarred boots with red turn‐over tops 
coming into view each time before the rest of his person.
- he describes exactly what happened

 On 
the counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of 
dried black bread, and some fish, chopped up small, all 
smelling very bad. It was insufferably close, and so heavy 
with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such an 
atmosphere might well make a man drunk.
- I think this description is interesting because it shows
how hard life is and why many people get drunk, simply to
alienate from reality

The  young  man  often  recalled  this  impression 
afterwards,  and  even  ascribed  it  to  presentiment.
- very interesting, he is making us antecipate something

 But there was 
something very strange in him; there was a light in his 
eyes as though of intense feeling—perhaps there were 
even thought and intelligence, but at the same time there 
was a gleam of something like madness.
- creating more anticipation of the character

He was wearing 
an old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its 
buttons missing except one, and that one he had buttoned, 
evidently clinging to this last trace of respectability.
- a good metaphor

"No,  I  am  studying,"  answered  the  young  man, 
somewhat  surprised  at  the  grandiloquent  style  of  the 
speaker and also at being so directly addressed. In spite of 
the  momentary  desire  he  had  just  been  feeling  for 
company of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt 
immediately his habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for 
any stranger who approached or attempted to approach 
him. 

"poverty is not a vice, that's a true saying. Yet I know too 
that drunkenness is not a virtue, and that that's even truer. 
But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a vice. In poverty 
you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but in 
beggary—never—no one.

It seemed  quite probable that he had not 
undressed or washed for the last five days. His hands, 
particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black 
nails.
- it is interesting how the exterior can tell us the interior
of a person

Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, 
and he had most likely acquired his weakness for high‐
flown speeches from the habit of frequently entering into 
conversation with strangers of all sorts in the tavern.
- interesting, the way he was to desabafar with others
is to talk to random people in taverns
- the author manages to create very peculiar characters

Excuse me, young man, has it ever 
happened to you... hm... well, to petition hopelessly for a 
loan?"
- both of them have many troubles

will  on  no 
consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why 
should he? For he knows of course that I shan't pay it back. 
From compassion? But Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up 
with  modern  ideas  explained  the  other  day  that 
compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and 
that that's what is done now in England, where there is 
political economy.
- this can be both interpreted as left wing ideology
- or simply showing the selfish of man

"Why do you go?" put in Raskolnikov.  
"Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go!
- interesting saying

Critics
- Marmeladov wife's story is very tragic

But her chest is 
weak and she has a tendency to consumption and I feel it! 
Do you suppose I don't feel it? And the more I drink the 
more I feel it. That's why I drink too. I try to find sympathy 
and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer twice as 
much!" And as though in despair he laid his head down on 
the table.
- very tragic

I do not 
wish to make myself a laughing‐stock before these idle 
listeners, who indeed know all about it already, but I am 
looking for a man of feeling and education
- he sees himself somehow in the main character, that's why
he started talking

I don't condemn her for it, I don't blame her, for the 
one thing left her is recollection of the past, and all the rest 
is dust and ashes.
- this remind a bit of IMO

Yes, yes, she is a lady of spirit, proud and 
determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has nothing 
but  black  bread  to  eat,  but  won't  allow  herself  to  be 
treated  with  disrespect.
- interestin

She married her first husband, an 
infantry officer, for love, and ran away with him from her 
father's house. She was exceedingly fond of her husband; 
but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he 
died.
- very tragedy, because she will always blame herself for
what she did
- did she change? does she continue to follow her heart

And she was proud, too, excessively 
proud...

Do 
you understand, sir, do you understand what it means 
when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?
- she 

Yellow ticket, yellow passport or yellow card[1] (Russian: жёлтый билет[2]) was an informal name of a personal identification document of a prostitute in the Russian Empire between 1843 and 1909.

Critics
- when Marmeladov got his job back you will feel how the
employee treats the employer as a favour, and an object

Boots, cotton shirt‐fronts—
most magnificent, a uniform, they got up all in splendid 
style, for eleven roubles and a half.
- interesting how money is valuable to poor people

She had not any dresses... none at all, but she got herself 
up as though she were going on a visit; and not that she'd 
anything to do it with, she smartened herself up with 
nothing at all, she'd done her hair nicely, put on a clean 
collar  of  some  sort,  cuffs,  and  there  she  was,  quite  a 
different  person,  she  was  younger  and  better  looking.
- money is morale

Critics
- Marmeladov story is sad because he had the opportunity
to recuperar a good life, and he blew it, damn, he literraly
stole money of his wife for some Piece of clothing

Sonia is a really nice person, even after all her father has
done she is still with him

 And here I, 
her own father, here I took thirty copecks of that money 
for a drink! And I am drinking it! And I have already drunk 
it! Come, who will have pity on a man like me, eh? Are you 
sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorry or not? 
He‐he‐he!"

 Indeed it will be better if she does begin 
pulling it, that's not what I am afraid of... it's her eyes I am 
afraid  of...  yes,  her  eyes...  the  red  on  her  cheeks,  too, 
frightens me... and her breathing too....

They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. 
The staircase got darker and darker as they went up. It 
was  nearly  eleven  o'clock  and  although  in  summer  in 
Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was quite dark at 
the top of the stairs.  
A grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood 
ajar. A very poor‐looking room about ten paces long was 
lighted up by a candle‐end; the whole of it was visible 
from the entrance.
- describing real poverty makes it more sad

# Chapter 3

He waked up late next day after a broken sleep.
- life is a constant source of misery for him

It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length. 
It had a poverty‐stricken appearance with its dusty yellow 
paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low‐pitched that 
a man of more than average height was ill at ease in it and 
felt every moment that he would knock his head against 
the ceiling.
- poverty in russia is insane

He had got completely away 
from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell, and even the 
sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and 
looked sometimes into his room made him writhe with 
nervous irritation.

"Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police 
about you," she said.

"Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness' sake; here are 
your three copecks, but for goodness' sake, make haste 
and go!"
- we can see his mother brings anxiety to him

But at 
last he lost all control and had the face to make Dounia an 
open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of 
inducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything 
and take her to another estate of his, or even abroad.
- Dounia must be very beautiful

You know Dounia, of course; you know how clever 
she is and what a strong will she has.

Critics
- it is interesting the impact of being poor. Due to being poor
Dounia has to put her self in situations that are not good
for money, and since there is no better alternative. In some
sense money means more options and more freedom.

For a whole month the town was full 
of gossip about this scandal, and it came to such a pass 
that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account 
of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks 
made aloud about us. 
- it interesting how doomed Raskolnikov's family seems to be doomed
apparently everything bad happens to them, imagine she could
go to a regular person's house, but suddenly she goes to a
very bad house

so in a short time she 
had spread her story not only in the town, but over the 
whole surrounding district

 It made me ill, but Dounia 
bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen 
how she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer 
me up!
- she seems to be a really strong woman

Marfa Petrovna is quite a character she is saying sorry for
everyone in the neighborhood, she has a high sense of nobility

In my opinion a great 
deal, a very great deal of all this was unnecessary; but 
that's Marfa Petrovna's character.
- that looks sketchy

Anyway she succeeded 
in completely re‐establishing Dounia's reputation and the 
whole  ignominy  of  this  affair  rested  as  an  indelible 
disgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, 
so that I really began to feel sorry for him; it was really 
treating the crazy fellow too harshly.
- maybe she did that to screw her husband and not to save Dounia,
I don't think she would be that nice

He is a well‐to‐do man, to be 
depended upon, he has two posts in the government and 
has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty‐five 
years old
- why a guy like this would want to marry Dounia, that sounds 
suspicious

You know your sister's 
character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and 
generous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know 
very well

Of course, there is no great love either on his 
side, or on hers, but Dounia is a clever girl and has the 
heart of an angel, and will make it her duty to make her 
husband happy who on his side will make her happiness
- Dounia is the type of woman that once starts a commitment
she will go all the way

But Dounia was vexed, 
and answered that 'words are not deeds,' and that, of 
course, is perfectly true.
- Dounia cares only not the presentation of the man,
but is actual feelings in his heart

We have 
even ventured already to drop a few words on the subject 
to Pyotr Petrovitch. He was cautious in his answer, and 
said that, of course, as he could not get on without a 
secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to a 
relation than to a stranger,
- this is too good to be true, some how the main character
will be fucked

 She has been in a sort of 
fever for the last few days, and has already made a regular 
plan for your becoming in the end an associate and even a 
partner in Pyotr Petrovitch's business, which might well 
be, seeing that you are a student of law.
- Dounia really loves her brother

I  have 
noticed more than once in my life that husbands don't 
quite get on with their mothers‐in‐law, and I don't want to 
be the least bit in anyone's way,
- the main character's mom is very sweet, interesting how
she and her daugther have a different sweetness, her daughter
is more like a harsh sweet, like though love

I have kept for 
the end of my letter: know then, my dear boy, that we may, 
perhaps, be all together in a very short time and may 
embrace one another again after a separation of almost 
three years!
- oh my god it couldn't be worst, the main character
would never like that

Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought of 
seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be 
ready to marry Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone.

Love Dounia your sister, Rodya; love her as she 
loves  you  and  understand  that  she  loves  you  beyond 
everything, more than herself. She is an angel and you, 
Rodya, you are everything to us—our one hope, our one 
consolation.
- this is even more sad, because not only the main character
is screwed but he is also the only hopes of his sister mother

He laid his 
head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, 
pondered a long time. His heart was beating violently, and 
his brain was in a turmoil.
- this is effective because we know how much he suffers, and
we can feel the implications of the letter

# Chapter 4

"Never such a marriage while I am alive and Mr. 
Luzhin  be  damned!"
- he is so prideful, how could he not be married

Raskolnikov is deeply offended by Luzhin's offer of marriage because he views Dunya as sacrificing herself to benefit him, and he cannot stand the idea of someone making such a sacrifice for him.
- damn that's really bad

(about Dounia) but I know she would 
rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German 
master than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity,

It's clear enough: for herself, for her comfort, to 
save her life she would not sell herself, but for someone 
else she is doing it! For one she loves, for one she adores, 
she will sell herself!

Critcs
- very interesting, how Casuistry morale can lead us to do something
without thinking rationally of the consequences

And I? Yes, indeed, what have you taken me for? I 
won't have your sacrifice, Dounia, I won't have it, mother! 
It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it shall not, it shall not! 
I won't accept it!
- I think he is overacting only based on the letter he can't
be sure that the guy is so bad

So  he  tortured  himself,  fr etting  himself  with  such 
questions, and finding a kind of enjoyment in it. And yet all 
these questions were not new ones suddenly confronting 
him, they were old familiar aches.
- interesting how bad this is, and how much that happens with
myself too

Long, long ago 
his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed 
and gathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, 
until  it  had  taken  the  form  of  a  fearful,  frenzied  and  
fantastic  question,  which  tortured  his  heart  and  mind, 
clamouring insistently for an answer
- this feels a lot like me

"Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it 
means  when  you  have  absolutely  nowhere  to  turn?" 
Marmeladov's question came suddenly into his mind, "for 
every man must have somewhere to turn...."

A certain percentage, they tell us, 
must every year go... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so 
that the rest may remain chaste, and not be interfered 
with. A percentage! What splendid words they have; they 
are  so  scientific,  so  consolatory....  Once  you've  said 
'percentage' there's nothing more to worry about. But what if Dounia were one of the percentage! Of another 
one if not that one? 

He 
was an exceptionally good‐humoured and candid youth, 
good‐natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth 
and dignity lay concealed under that simplicity.
- why a guy like that would be friends with the main character


# Chapter 5

Critics
- now he is talking about a dream of the main character
which is quite boring

alguma coisa acontece no meu coracao que so quando sai do
metro da consolacao

He was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in 
like a man condemned to death. He thought of nothing and 
was incapable of thinking; but  he  felt suddenly in his 
whole being that he had no more freedom of thought, no 
will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably 
decided. 

# CHAPTER VI

But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The 
traces of superstition remained in him long after, and 
were almost ineradicable

All at once he heard the 
student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona 
Ivanovna and give him her address. This of itself seemed 
strange to Raskolnikov; he had just come from her and 
here at once he heard her name.
- interesting coincidence

Lizaveta was of lower rank than 
her sister, unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, 
remarkably tall with long feet that looked as if they were 
bent outwards.
- poor girl

Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives 
thrown away for want of help and by thousands, on every 
side! A hundred thousand good deeds could be done and 
helped, on that old woman's money which will be buried 
in a monastery!
- ver interesting moral dilema

Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives 
thrown away for want of help and by thousands, on every 
side! A hundred thousand good deeds could be done and 
helped, on that old woman's money which will be buried 
in a monastery!

This  trivial  talk  in  a  tavern  had  an  
immense influence on him in his later action; as though 
there had really been in it something preordained, some 
guiding hint....  

Meanwhile it got dark; he had no candle and, indeed, it did 
not occur to him to light up. 

He was haunted by day‐dreams and such strange 
day‐dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he 
was in Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan 
was resting, the camels were peacefully lying down; the 
palms stood all around in a complete circle; all the party 
were at dinner. But he was drinking water from a spring 
which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was 
wonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the 
parti‐coloured  stones  and  over  the  clean  sand  which  
glistened here and there like gold....
- he can feel how good life will be after the crime

He  concentrated  all  his  energies  on  thinking  of 
everything  and  forgetting  nothing;  and  his  heart  kept 
beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe.
- the fact that this is a crime movie where the guy doesn't
want to commit a crime is quite interesting

This noose, too, he had designed a fortnight 
before.
- he has been planning this for quite a while

In spite of all his agonising inward 
struggle, he never for a single instant all that time could 
believe in the carrying out of his plans.
- this is very interesting

Almost every criminal is subject to a 
failure  of  will  and  reasoning  power  by  a  childish  and 
phenomenal  heedlessness,  at  the  very  instant  when  
prudence  and  caution  are  most  essential.  It  was  his  
conviction that this eclipse of reason and failure of will 
power attacked a man like a disease, developed gradually 
and reached its highest point just before the perpetration 
of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment 
of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according 
to the individual case, and then passed off like any other 
disease.
- very interesting reflection

When he reached these conclusions, he decided that in 
his own case there could not be such a morbid reaction, 
that his reason and will would remain unimpaired at the 
time of carrying out his design, for the simple reason that 
his design was "not a crime...."
- is this a crime, what is far?

He was crushed and even humiliated. He could have 
laughed at himself in his anger.... A dull animal rage boiled 
within him.
- the stress

He 
moved a little on purpose and muttered something aloud 
that he might not have the appearance of hiding, then rang 
a third time, but quietly, soberly, and without impatience, 
Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out in his mind 
vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he 
had had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded 
at moments and he was almost unconscious of his body....
- interesting how we can be clutch at the necessary moments,
it's an instinct of survival

# CHAPTER VII

The old woman recovered herself, 
and  her  visitor's  resolute  tone  evidently  restored  her 
confidence.

His 
hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment 
growing more numb and more wooden. He was afraid he 
would let the axe slip and fall.... A sudden giddiness came 
over him.
- imagine killing someone when you are hungry

She was gazing in stupefaction at her 
murdered sister, white as a sheet and seeming not to have 
the strength to cry out.
- very impactful

Fear  gained  more  and  more  mastery  over  him, 
especially after this second, quite unexpected murder.

He stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the 
door, the outer door from the stairs, at which he had not 
long before waited and rung, was standing unfastened and 
at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt, all the time, all 
that  time!
- it is amazing how dreadful this things get
- the paranoia will eat him

When 
he was in his room, he flung himself on the sofa just as he 
was—he did not sleep, but sank into blank forgetfulness. If 
anyone  had  come  into  his  room  then,  he  would  have 
jumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of 
thoughts were simply swarming in his brain, but he could 
not catch at one, he could not rest on one, in spite of all his 
efforts....
