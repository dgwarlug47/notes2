she is maybe not that innocent, since she suspected that Newland had a lover and that's why they he was trying to hasting the marriage.

# Newland Archer

"Archer had always being incliined to think that chance and cirumstance
innate tendency to have things happen to them"

"But once he was married what would become of his narrow margin of life in which his
real experiences were lived? He had seen e nough of the young men who had dreamed his dream, though perhaps lesss aredently, and who had gradually sunk into the  placid and luxurios routine or their elders."

# Ellen

she invited herself to meet Newland, out of nowhere

she said the Duke of the richest man in new york was dullest man alive

When I first watched the movie, I fell in love with Wynona Ryder, because
she is simply so fucking gorgeous, but now i am falling in love with Ellen
because she is simply so odd, in the sense that she doesn't fit at all
New York society, she feels so bold and free spirited, she doesn't bow to
the established standard of forms, and taste and simply lives in her own way
in a society very rigid with rules and all that

she has the courage to be herself

"Does anything ever happen in heaven"

It was a matter of time until she got banned from Old new york, after all she has
always been heavily hetheredox
