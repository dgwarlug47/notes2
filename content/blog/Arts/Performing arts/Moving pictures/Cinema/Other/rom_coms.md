# How Aristotle Would Summarize "500 Days of Summer"

## Aristotelian Summary (5 sentences)

Tom suffers from **akrasia** (ἀκρασία) - acting against his knowledge that Summer doesn't want commitment. He mistakes romantic love for **eudaimonia** (εὐδαιμονία), making another person his **telos** (τέλος) rather than developing his own **arete** (ἀρετή). Through repeated disappointment, his **hexis** (ἕξις) slowly changes as he learns **phronesis** (φρόνησις) about relationships. His suffering serves as **catharsis** (κάθαρσις), leading to **anagnorisis** (ἀναγνώρισις) - the recognition that happiness must come from within. By the end, he achieves **mesotes** (μεσότης) in love - neither excessive attachment nor emotional withdrawal.

# How Aristotle Would Summarize "Yes Man"

## Aristotelian Summary (5 sentences)

Carl begins in a state of **stasis** (στάσις) - avoiding his **ergon** (ἔργον) as a social being through constant rejection of opportunities. His transformation through saying "yes" represents movement from **hexis** (ἕξις) of withdrawal toward **energeia** (ἐνέργεια) - actualizing his human potential. However, his extreme commitment to "yes" violates **mesotes** (μεσότης), swinging from deficiency (always saying no) to excess (never saying no). Through **peripeteia** (περιπέτεια) - his relationship troubles - he learns **phronesis** (φρόνησις) about when to say yes and when to say no. He achieves **eudaimonia** (εὐδαιμονία) not through blind positivity, but through **practical wisdom** in choosing which opportunities serve human flourishing.

# How Aristotle Would Summarize "It's Kind of a Funny Story"

## Aristotelian Summary (5 sentences)

Craig suffers from **dysthymia** leading to **akrasia** (ἀκρασία) - knowing he should value life but acting against this knowledge through suicidal ideation. His hospitalization forces him to confront his false **telos** (τέλος) - believing academic/social success equals **eudaimonia** (εὐδαιμονία). Through **koinonia** (κοινωνία) with fellow patients, he develops **philia** (φιλία) based on mutual understanding rather than superficial achievement. His artistic awakening represents **energeia** (ἐνέργεια) - actualizing his creative **ergon** (ἔργον) rather than pursuing others' expectations. He achieves **sophrosyne** (σωφροσύνη) by learning to moderate his ambitions and find the **mesotes** (μεσότης) between self-destruction and manic overachievement.

# How Aristotle Would Summarize "50 First Dates"

## Aristotelian Summary (5 sentences)

Henry begins practicing **techne** (τέχνη) without **arete** (ἀρετή) - using his charm as mere craft for shallow conquests rather than genuine **philia** (φιλία). Lucy's condition forces him to confront what constitutes authentic **energeia** (ἐνέργεια) - whether love is just repeated actions or sustained **hexis** (ἕξις) of character. His daily courtship becomes a test of **kartereia** (καρτερία) - patient endurance that reveals his capacity for true **agape** rather than mere **eros**. Through **praxis** (πρᾶξις) - repeatedly choosing to love without memory of reward - he transforms from someone seeking pleasure to someone capable of **eudaimonia** (εὐδαιμονία) through service. He achieves **megalopsychia** (μεγαλοψυχία) - greatness of soul - by finding meaning in love that transcends personal gain and temporal recognition.

# How Aristotle Would Summarize "Notting Hill"

## Aristotelian Summary (5 sentences)

William suffers from **mikropsychia** (μικροψυχία) - smallness of soul that makes him believe he's unworthy of extraordinary love, violating the **mesotes** (μεσότης) through excessive humility. Anna's fame creates a false **hierarchy** that contradicts **isonomia** (ἰσονομία) - the equality necessary for genuine **philia** (φιλία) between rational beings. Their relationship fluctuates between **stasis** (στάσις) and **kinesis** (κίνησις) as William learns **andreia** (ἀνδρεία) - the courage to claim his worth despite social differences. Through **peripeteia** (περιπέτεια) - public humiliation and private reflection - he develops **phronesis** (φρόνησις) about what constitutes true value in relationships. He achieves **eudaimonia** (εὐδαιμονία) by recognizing that love transcends external circumstances and choosing **praxis** (πρᾶξις) - virtuous action regardless of outcome.

# How Aristotle Would Summarize "Annie Hall"

## Aristotelian Summary (5 sentences)

Alvy suffers from chronic **akrasia** (ἀκρασία) - knowing what behaviors damage relationships yet compulsively repeating them through neurotic self-sabotage. His **episteme** (ἐπιστήμη) about love conflicts with his **hexis** (ἕξις) of anxiety, preventing him from achieving the **ataraxia** (ἀταραξία) necessary for sustained **philia** (φιλία). Annie's growth represents **kinesis** (κίνησις) toward **eudaimonia** (εὐδαιμονία), while Alvy remains trapped in **stasis** (στάσις) - unable to evolve beyond his neuroses. Through **anamnesis** (ἀνάμνησις) - flashbacks that reveal patterns - he gains **gnosis** (γνῶσις) about his destructive habits but lacks the **enkrateia** (ἐγκράτεια) to change them. He achieves a limited **sophia** (σοφία) - understanding that love requires letting go - but cannot actualize this wisdom in **praxis** (πρᾶξις), remaining intellectually aware but emotionally **akratic**.

# How Aristotle Would Summarize "The Holiday"

## Aristotelian Summary (5 sentences)

Both Amanda and Iris begin in states of **pseudophilia** (ψευδοφιλία) - false friendship/love that violates their **autarkeia** (αὐτάρκεια) through emotional dependency on unworthy partners. Their geographical **metabasis** (μετάβασις) - literal change of place - creates the conditions for **metanoia** (μετάνοια), a fundamental transformation of mind and character. Through **xenophilia** (ξενοφιλία) - love of the foreign/new - they escape their established **hexis** (ἕξις) patterns and discover their capacity for **andreia** (ἀνδρεία) in relationships. Each woman's **anagnorisis** (ἀναγνώρισις) comes through **praxis** (πρᾶξις) - Amanda learning vulnerability, Iris claiming self-worth - rather than mere intellectual insight. They achieve **eudaimonia** (εὐδαιμονία) by discovering that **autarkeia** (self-sufficiency) is the foundation for genuine **koinonia** (κοινωνία) with others.
