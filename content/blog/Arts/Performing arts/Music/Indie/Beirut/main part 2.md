### Poor
- [MYTAKE] I would say that East Harlem is one of the greatest examples of juxtaposed inequalities in the world. A higher level of Morumbi vs Paraisopolis.
	- [MYTAKE] Beirut is a band about multiple cultures collide, and the interesting fact is that he wrote a song that involves inequality, which is a similarity on all cultures.

### Lyrics

Sound is the color I know
Sound is what keeps me before your eyes
And sound of your breath in the cold
And oh, the sound will bring me home again
- [MYTAKE] I think it's really beautiful his relationship with the sound. It as if sound for him it's not a sense, or even a medium of enjoyment such as music, it is where he actually feels at home, for me that is very profound.

# No No No (Their third album)
- Came after the hospitalization of Zach due to Burnout and his divorce
