        <h2>The Roots of My Curiosity</h2>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
          I inherit my profound love for knowledge from my grandfather on my mother's side, 
          Ananias de Farias Cavalcanti, born in Riacho do Meio, Paraiba, Brazil, on July 24th, 1931. 
        </p>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6' }}> 
          He was a man of methodical habits who would spend two hours getting ready each morning, 
          and whenever he was home, you'd find him with a book in his hands. His personal library 
          was a treasure trove: the Bible, World War II books, works by Erico Verissimo, 
          Edgar Allan Poe, Dostoevsky, and much more. 
        </p>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Beyond books, he was a curator of memoryâ€”carefully preserving photo albums 
          that captured the essence of Pernambuco's towns and meticulously documenting 
          our family's stories. His beliefs were as layered as his intellect: from polemic political positions 
          to a journey through Catholicism, atheism, and finally found peace in Baptist 
          faith. Yet through every transformation, his devotion to learning never faltered. 
          
        </p>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', marginTop: '15px' }}>
          Unfortunately, he passed away when I was only four years old, and I have never since 
          met someone who shared such profound curiosity. Though our time together was brief, 
          his intellectual legacy lives on in me. This blog is my way of honoring that inherited 
          curiosity and methodical pursuit of knowledge that he embodied so completely.
